# Interface

Build it by loading, not by inventing.

The problem this exists for, in Caleb's words: **"right now it's laggy because
it's needed to every time recalibrate how to make something."** The cost of
generating a UI is not rendering. It is the model re-deciding, per request,
what a dashboard is, what spacing to use, what a good table looks like and
where the data comes from. All four of those are written down here, once.

## The order, every time

1. **Name the template.** `references/taxonomy.md` has ten. The request is
   almost always one of them, and the one most people mean is Dashboard.
2. **Name the organisms it holds**, from the same file. Stop here if you are
   about to invent a component that already has a name.
3. **Find the data** in `references/data-loaders.md`, and when it is not there
   use `references/discover-data.md` to go find it, appending what you learn
   back into the loaders file so the next session does not repeat the search.
4. **Apply the system**, from [crafts/interface.md](../../crafts/interface.md):
   grayscale first, the constrained scale, hierarchy by size and weight and
   color, too much whitespace then remove, details last.
5. **Build the three states.** Loading, empty, error. This is the step that
   gets skipped, because the prompt only ever describes the happy path.

Steps 1 to 3 are lookups and should cost almost nothing. That is the point.

## Pick the stance from the reader, not from taste

On 2026-09-27 Amber Circles passed ux-lint, axe, layout-check and design-gate
in the editorial stance (serif display, one gold italic phrase, an uppercase
kicker over every heading, outline buttons) and Caleb called it AI slop. It
was: that look is now the median "tasteful" generated page, and every gate
scores the absence of the old tells, not this one.

The fix that landed was choosing the stance from who reads it. The users were
older people opening links from texts, so it became signage (ux-engine
`material`) in Atkinson Hyperlegible, the Braille Institute's face for low
vision. Two rules came out of it:

- **Give the accent exactly one meaning** ("you can tap this") and write a
  test that fails when it fills anything else. The first signage landing had
  four amber things above the fold and design-gate read it LOUD at ink 0.52.
- **Show the content as itself.** The text a group actually receives, each
  tool as a live thumbnail the way Docs shows pages, faces instead of counts.
  A description of the product is the generated move.

## One theme, never re-chosen

Caleb: "keep it the same theme." Tokens are defined once per surface and
referenced everywhere. A generator that picks a fresh accent color per artifact
produces a pile of demos rather than a product, and the tell is obvious the
moment two of them sit side by side.

## Where the thing renders

| Surface         | Use                                       | Reach it with                              |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **HUD**         | Ambient, live, over other apps, no window | `hud` and the `hud` skill                  |
| **Local page**  | Something to click through or keep open   | an HTML file, opened                       |
| **In the repo** | Part of a product being built             | the project's own stack, per `stack-rules` |

Pick the surface before the layout. An overlay HUD and a settings page are
different templates, and building the second one into the first is the common
mistake.

## Reference files

- [references/taxonomy.md](references/taxonomy.md): every component and
  template, named, grouped by the job it does. Read at steps 1 and 2.
- [references/data-loaders.md](references/data-loaders.md): every data source
  already reachable on this machine, and the four shapes any new one arrives
  in. Read at step 3.
- [references/discover-data.md](references/discover-data.md): the procedure for
  a source nothing covers yet, cheapest method first, ending in pixels only as
  a last resort. Read when step 3 misses.
- [crafts/interface.md](../../crafts/interface.md): the researched rules, from
  Refactoring UI and Atomic Design. Read at step 4.

## The hard line

**Never invent a component that has a name in the taxonomy.** A bespoke variant
of a table is the recalibration this skill exists to prevent, it will not match
the next one generated, and nobody asked for it.

# SessionStart: inject personal context, and today's tasks if Todoist is wired.
#
# Why this is a script and not an inline settings.json command:
#
#   1. The inline version was one string with seven levels of backslash
#      escaping. It worked, and nobody could read or safely change it.
#
#   2. It injected raw template scaffolding into every session: empty headings,
#      "- ..." bullets, "| ... | ... |" table rows, PROJECT_NAME. Until you
#      actually fill in YOU.md that is pure token cost with no signal. This
#      strips placeholders and drops headings that have nothing under them.
#
#   3. It baked the literal Todoist token into the hook command. The token now
#      comes from the environment, so settings.json holds one copy in `env`
#      instead of a second copy pasted inside a shell string.
#
# Config comes from ~/.claude/d1-config.sh, written by setup.sh.

# twenty open-ended ones. It says nothing unless it actually found something.

# Caleb, 2026-09-21: "how is chewbacca storing during session important context?
# I feel like ur gonna forget the to dos we set at the beginning of this
# session?" He was right, and nothing was storing it.
#
# ~/.chewbacca/session-state/ records which files a session WROTE. Nothing
# recorded what a session DECIDED, so a backlog agreed at the top of a session
# lived in one context window and died with it.
#
# Only the Now block, which is six rows. The rest is one `backlog all` away. A
# session briefing that prints thirty items is one nobody reads, and this file's
# own header already makes that argument about template scaffolding.
# ${VAR:-} on every reference. This file runs under `set -u`, so naming an
# unset variable is fatal, and CHEWBACCA_ROOT is not set for anybody who has
# not exported it. The first version of this block referenced it bare and took
# the whole session briefing down with it on 2026-09-21, silently, for every
# machine but the one it was written on.
# The repo setup.sh ran from is in the install manifest. Without that lookup
# this block never ran on Gavin's Mac: CHEWBACCA_ROOT is unset there and the
# default below is Caleb's path, so the backlog was silently skipped until
# 2026-09-27.

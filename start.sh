# Written for someone who just put Claude on a laptop, has no GitHub account,
# has never opened Terminal before today, and should not have to care about any
# of that. Three things it deliberately does differently from `git clone`:
#
#   1. Downloads a tarball, not a repo. codeload.github.com serves those to
#      anyone, so no account, no git, no `gh auth login`.
#   2. Installs to ~/.chewbacca, not to a Chewbacca folder in whatever
#      directory they happened to be standing in. They will never trip over it.
#   3. Waits for the Command Line Tools dialog instead of telling them to come
#      back and run something again. Nobody comes back.
#
# It asks nothing. Every answer it needs it either detects or defaults, and
# anything it cannot decide is left for Claude to ask in conversation, which is
# the whole design of the kit.

# ── Introduce yourself before doing anything ─────────────────────────────────
cat <<INTRO

  ${B}Chewbacca${N}
  Makes the Claude you already pay for a lot better at your actual life.

  This will:
    1. Check what your Mac already has
    2. Install what is missing (Apple's developer tools, Homebrew, Node)
    3. Download Chewbacca to ~/.chewbacca
    4. Set up Claude to read your calendar, send texts, and see your screen
    5. Open Claude and introduce you

  Before any of it runs, here is exactly what it touches:

    Chewbacca configuration goes in your account:
      ~/.chewbacca        the kit itself
      ~/.claude           what your agent reads every session
      ~/.local/bin        the commands it installs

    It will ask for your Mac password ONCE, and only for Homebrew, which
    installs shared developer tools outside your account. Nothing else here
    needs it.

    Setup downloads software. Agent conversations and connected services can
    send data to their providers. Personal data imports are separate choices.

    To remove kit configuration later: chewbacca uninstall
    Personal stores and separately installed software may remain.

  About 10 minutes, most of it downloads. Add --fast to install only the part
  that makes the agent know you, which takes seconds instead.

# PreToolUse on Write|Edit: refuse to write a UI file carrying the generated look.
#
# THIS WAS A PostToolUse HOOK AND IT DID NOT WORK.
#
# The docs are explicit: "PostToolUse | No | Exit code 2 isn't honored for this
# event. The tool already ran." The previous version exited 2 from PostToolUse
# and the README claimed it "blocks the turn." It did not. It printed findings
# after the file was already on disk, and the test asserted the exit code
# rather than the blocking, so it passed while proving nothing.
#
# Caught 2026-09-20 by an adversarial prior-art review that read the hooks
# reference. Moved to PreToolUse, where exit 2 genuinely blocks the tool call,
# and the content is linted BEFORE it is written.
#
# Which is also the better architecture on the evidence: research/14 found
# post-editing does not work and fails invisibly, so a gate that fires after
# the artifact exists is working at the end of the pipeline where the leverage
# is not.

# critique runs near 34%. A blocking gate made of house opinion is roughly

# literature says what happens then: 61-68% of suppressions are "unactionable",
# meaning the rule was right in general and wrong here.

# wants more enforced writes its own DENY.md, which is external authority from
# this tool's point of view. That is the axe-core move.

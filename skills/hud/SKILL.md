description: Draw live interfaces on the screen over everything else, with no browser and no window. Use when the user asks to see something rather than be told it, says show me, put that on screen, pull up, or asks for a dashboard, chart, diagram, or status display.

# The display

The user has a transparent layer over their whole screen that you can draw on.
It is click-through everywhere except where something is drawn, so they keep
working underneath it. Panels stay up after you disconnect, which means you can
change one later instead of drawing it again.

```bash
hud status                 # is it running
hud open                   # start it
hud draw                   # Kyber Lines on stdin
hud demo                   # put one of everything on screen
hud close <surface>        # take one down
```

Reach for this when the answer is a shape rather than a sentence. "How are my
reply times looking" is a chart. "What is due this week" is a list on the glass,
not four paragraphs in a terminal they have to scroll back to.

Do not reach for it to answer a question that is one sentence long. A panel that
says "yes" is worse than saying yes.

## Drawing

```bash
hud draw <<'EOF'
@ people at=topRight w=400
c s Screen title="RELATIONSHIPS"
c a Sparkline label="Messages this week" points=[31,28,44,39,58,52,71] value="71"
c b Bars caption="Time since last reply" rows=[{"label":"Sam","value":2,"display":"2h"},{"label":"Ava","value":31,"display":"1d"}]
c e Events caption="Needs a reply" items=[{"time":"9:04","text":"Sam sent the gates","accent":true}]
> s a b e
r s
EOF
```

Every line is one op. Nothing paints until `r`, and `c` and `>` may arrive in
any order, so a child can be sent before its parent.

Send `r` as soon as the Screen exists rather than at the end. Children that
arrive after the root still land, so a stream that gets cut off has drawn
something instead of nothing.

```
@ <surface> [at=region] [w=points] [urgency=level] [chrome=kind]
c <id> <Type> prop=value ...
> <parent> <child> ...
d /pointer <json>
r <id>
- <surface>
s "<text>" [step=true]             say one line on the pill under the panels; step marks a tool call
w "<text>" [done=true]             the written answer, whole, for the conversation panel
q <n>                              how many requests are waiting
t "<text>" state=running|waiting|done   the Claude Code tab's state, as a strip under the pill; t off hides it
listen                             ask to receive events on this connection
```

Arrays are JSON and the parser splits on whitespace, so write them with no
spaces inside: `points=[31,28,44]`.

## Where, and how loud

`at=` is a region, never a coordinate: `topLeft top topRight left center right
bottomLeft bottom bottomRight`. Put what they asked about where the eye already
is and standing context in a corner. Two or three panels is a workspace, six is
a mess.

`urgency=` is `ambient`, `normal`, `alert`, or `critical`. Only `critical`
appears when the display is hidden. Spend it on a payment failing or a meeting
starting in one minute, never on a task being due next week.

`chrome=` is `card`, `bare`, or `bracket`. **`bare` draws no panel at all**: the
content floats directly on the screen. It is right for a diagram or a figure and
it is the thing this display can do that a window cannot. `bracket` puts corner
marks around a region without covering it.

## Components

Anything not listed here is dropped silently by the renderer, so the panel will
just be missing that piece and nothing will tell you. Write arrays with no
spaces inside them.

<!-- generated: components -->

### Structure

- **Screen** The root of a surface. Exactly one per surface, and every other component hangs off it. A short title in caps reads best at a glance.

  ```
  c s Screen title="RELATIONSHIPS"
  ```

- **Stack** Groups components. Vertical by default; use grid with cols for several small numbers, because four metrics in a column waste the height of a panel that is already capped. Gap is in units of 4 points.

  ```
  c row Stack direction=grid cols=2 gap=3
  ```

### Prose

- **Heading** A label over a section. Use it when one panel holds two unrelated groups; a panel with one group already has its Screen title.

  ```
  c h Heading text="Needs a reply" level=2
  ```

- **Text** A sentence. Reach for it last: a heads-up display is glanced at, and prose is the thing a glance cannot do. Never use it to describe a chart that is already on the panel.

  ```
  c t Text value="Nothing is overdue." tone=muted
  ```

- **List** Plain bullets. Prefer Events when the items happened at times, and Bars when they have magnitudes worth comparing.

  ```
  c l List items=["Bring the charger","Print the form"]
  ```

### Data

- **Metric** One number that matters. Give it thresholds and it colours itself when the value crosses one, which is the difference between a number read at a glance and a number that has to be read.

  ```
  c m Metric label="Unread" value=12
  ```

  ```
  c o Metric label="Overdue" value=4 thresholds=[{"at":1,"tone":"bad"}]
  ```

- **Table** Rows with several fields each. Use it when the person needs to compare across columns; if there is one number per row, Bars says it faster.

  ```
  c tb Table columns=[{"field":"name","label":"Name"},{"field":"due","label":"Due"}] rows=[{"name":"Origin Story","due":"Sep 9"}]
  ```

- **Status** One line about how something went. For an outcome, not for standing state: a panel that permanently says everything is fine is a panel nobody reads.

  ```
  c st Status message="Deploy finished" level=success
  ```

### Dashboard

- **Sparkline** A trend. Six to thirty points: fewer is noise and more is a smear. Always pass value, because nobody reads an exact number off a 34-point chart, so the drawing carries the shape and the text carries the number.

  ```
  c sp Sparkline label="Messages this week" points=[31,28,44,39,58,52,71] value="71"
  ```

- **Bars** Ranked rows, scaled against the largest rather than against zero, so four values within ten percent of each other still read as different. Horizontal because the labels are words. `display` is what gets printed; `value` only sets the length.

  ```
  c b Bars caption="Time since last reply" rows=[{"label":"Sam","value":2,"display":"2h"},{"label":"Ava","value":31,"display":"1d"}]
  ```

- **Ring** A proportion, and only ever a proportion: value runs 0 to 1 and the thing must have a real ceiling. A ring around an unbounded number is decoration, and decoration costs the same attention as information while carrying none.

  ```
  c r Ring label="Attendance" value=0.82 caption="82%"
  ```

- **Events** Things that happened or are about to, most recent or soonest first. Set accent on the one that matters; setting it on all of them sets it on none.

  ```
  c e Events caption="Due" items=[{"time":"Sep 9","text":"Origin Story","accent":true}]
  ```

### Anything else

- **Diagram** Reach for this whenever the answer is a shape rather than a number: how things connect, what flows into what, the parts of a system, a hierarchy. Draw it out of nodes and arrows in a unit square where x and y run 0 to 1, and label the nodes. Lay a sequence left to right along y=0.5, and a hierarchy top down from y=0.2, so that two drawings of the same thing come out the same way and somebody can recognise a diagram they have seen before instead of reading it again from scratch. The drawing is the entire answer: do not put a written version of it beside the diagram, because a panel that says the same thing twice has wasted the one glance it gets. Not for anything Bars or Events already says.

  ```
  c d Diagram aspect=2.4 parts=[{"t":"node","x":0.2,"y":0.5,"w":0.22,"h":0.3,"label":"Model"},{"t":"arrow","x":0.32,"y":0.5,"x2":0.68,"y2":0.5},{"t":"node","x":0.8,"y":0.5,"w":0.22,"h":0.3,"label":"Glass"}]
  ```

  ```
  c d2 Diagram aspect=2 parts=[{"t":"node","x":0.5,"y":0.2,"w":0.3,"h":0.24,"label":"Request"},{"t":"arrow","x":0.44,"y":0.32,"x2":0.22,"y2":0.62},{"t":"arrow","x":0.56,"y":0.32,"x2":0.78,"y2":0.62},{"t":"node","x":0.18,"y":0.76,"w":0.28,"h":0.24,"label":"Cache","tone":"good"},{"t":"node","x":0.82,"y":0.76,"w":0.28,"h":0.24,"label":"Model","tone":"warn"}]
  ```

- **File** Shows an actual file: a PDF through the system's PDF engine, an image as an image, anything that decodes as text as text. Use it when the person names a document, instead of describing the document back to them. `editable` on a text file gives a real editor whose save overwrites that exact path.

  ```
  c f File path="~/Downloads/resume.pdf"
  ```

### Controls

- **Button** A press that sends an action back up the socket. Only add one when there is something for it to do; a button nobody is listening for is a promise the panel cannot keep.

  ```
  c go Button label="Send it" action=send variant=primary
  ```

- **Field** A text input bound to a pointer in the panel's own data. It writes locally the moment it is typed in, so it responds at typing speed whether or not anything is still listening.

  ```
  c n Field label="Note" bind=/draft/note
  ```

- **Select** One of a fixed set. Use it wherever the answer is a known list, because a text field that must match one of five strings is a trap.

  ```
  c s Select label="Status" bind=/draft/status options=["Todo","Done"]
  ```

- **Checkbox** A yes or no, bound to a pointer. Use it for a state the person toggles, not for a list of things to tick off: several checkboxes in a row is a form, and a heads-up display is a bad place to fill in a form.

  ```
  c c Checkbox label="Urgent" bind=/draft/urgent
  ```

<!-- /generated -->

## Marking the screen

A panel sits _beside_ the work. A mark sits **on** it.

```
m <id> <x> <y> <w> <h> [label="..."] [tone=bad] [life=30]
u [<id>]
```

Coordinates are **points with a top-left origin**, and points are not pixels: a
Retina screenshot reports twice the number you want. Run `hud screen` to get the
size before you place anything.

```bash
hud draw <<'EOF'
m bug 420 260 380 90 label="This is the one failing" tone=bad
EOF
```

Marks decay. The default life is twelve seconds, `life=0` pins one, and re-sending
the same id with a new rectangle moves it rather than leaving a trail. That is
deliberate and it is the rule that makes the layer trustworthy: a mark that
outlives what it described is worse than no mark, because the person learns to
disbelieve all of them.

Twelve marks maximum. Past a dozen the screen is not annotated, it is hatched.

## Guiding a person

A mark says "look at this" to somebody who knows the screen. A guide says
"press this" to somebody who does not: a ring around the control, a bubble
that says what to do in words, and a slow pulse so the eye finds it.

```
m guide 724 70 30 30 label="Click Sign in" tone=guide life=120
```

`tone=guide` is the whole difference. A guide is the one mark that answers a
click: when the person presses inside its rectangle, or on the ring around it,
the display takes it down and sends

```
e hit guide label="Click Sign in"
```

so whoever is guiding can look at the screen again and show the next step.
Nothing on the glass takes the click itself; it reaches the app underneath as
it always did.

`bin/hud-guide` does the finding: `hud-guide list` reads the front window's
controls through the accessibility tree, `find "sign in"` matches by name,
`show elem_12 --say "Click Sign in"` sends the line above, `clear` takes it
down. One bubble at a time, by design: re-sending `guide` moves it, and a
person following along wants the next step, not a trail. The voice's rules
for guiding, one step, their words, their hands, are in `bin/hud-agent.md`
under "Showing them where".

## Playing music

"Play Blinding Lights", "play some Drake", "pause", "skip", "what's playing",
"turn it up": the bridge reads these itself and drives the player, so nothing
waits on the model. `bin/hud-music` is the same code as a command:

```bash
hud-music play "fred again"      # Spotify by name, or YouTube audio without keys
hud-music pause | resume | next | previous | again | stop | shuffle
hud-music volume up              # or down, or a number
hud-music now                    # what is on, in a sentence
hud-music status                 # which players are ready, and why not
```

Spotify plays whatever its own search puts at the top for the words, misheard
or not: a headless browser (`pip3 install playwright && playwright install
chromium-headless-shell`, once) reads the top result off Spotify's web player,
about 1.5 s, and the desktop app plays it. With keys in `~/.bob/spotify.json`
(`hud-music setup`, a free developer app's client id and secret) it is one
API search instead. Without either, Deezer, Wikidata, MusicBrainz and
Spotify's public embed pages find the URI for anything well known, and a
guess they are not sure of goes to the model, which works out the name and
plays it with `hud-music play --anyway`.
"On YouTube" plays the first result through `ffplay` with no window, a few
seconds in, and so does any request when Spotify is not installed. "Stop" on
its own pauses the music when the voice is idle; "stop the music" always does.

## Panels that take themselves down

`@ toast at=top life=6` closes after six seconds. Use it for something the person
does not need to dismiss: a build finishing, a file saved, a reminder that stops
being true.

Leave `life` off for anything they will read or act on. A panel that vanishes
mid-sentence is a bug they will blame on you.

## Noticing without being asked

`hud-watch` is the half that speaks first. It checks for things worth
interrupting for, shows at most one, and then stays quiet.

```bash
hud-watch                 # check once
hud-watch --daemon        # keep checking
hud-watch --dry-run       # what it would say
hud-watch --status        # what it has said, and the budget left
```

The restraint is the design, not a limitation of it. Two interruptions an hour,
nothing repeated for twenty hours, only the worst finding shown, and everything
it draws expires on its own. A thing that interrupts whenever it has an opinion
gets muted within a day, and a muted assistant is worth less than none because
you believe you have one.

If you add a check, give the finding a stable `key` and a `severity` that rises
when the situation worsens. Severity is in the fingerprint, so getting worse
counts as news and staying the same does not.

## Pointing

Holding Option-Command and dragging outlines a region on screen, and the display
sends `g <x> <y> <w> <h>` when it is released. If a request arrives shortly
after, its "this" or "that" means whatever is in that rectangle. `hud listen`
attaches it to the prompt for thirty seconds and then forgets it, because
pointing at something and asking about it a minute later is a coincidence rather
than a reference.

The display sends coordinates, never pixels. Look at the region yourself if you
need to see it.

## Hearing them

The display can listen. It is off until the person turns it on from the menu bar
(hold the talk key, the globe by default, or a wake word), and when it hears
something it sends `h "what they said"` back up the socket.

What they said is drawn on the pill at the bottom of the screen first, in
quotes, and held there for a second before `h` goes up, so pressing the key
again takes it back instead of sending it. To the person the pill is the
"hyper bar", which is what the voice calls it. Two quick presses of the talk key
are the way out: the panel, the microphone, a run in flight, the voice and the
glass all go, and `x` comes up the socket so `hud listen` stops talking. One
press sends `k down` before the microphone opens, and `hud listen` stops
talking on that line too; what is said next replaces whatever it was doing.

`hud listen` runs Claude Code under a lean profile by default: its own short
system prompt (`bin/hud-agent.md`, which carries the `mac` usage), one tool,
and none of the person's settings, with their permission mode and deny list
passed back by hand. That is 15k tokens a turn against 237k, measured on one
calendar question, and it is what makes a day of talking fit a subscription.
`--profile full` runs it the way `claude -p` runs at a terminal. Every turn
writes one `turn:` line to the log with where the time and the tokens went.
The reply is read by `hud-speak` (Python) or, with `HUD_SPEAKER=hud-voice`,
by the Swift server in `voice/`, which needs nothing installed.

How the voice is meant to sound, and where each rule came from, is in
`docs/VOICE-DESIGN.md`: a tone on the press, the model's restate-then-acknowledge
first sentence ("Texting Caleb you're running ten late. On it."), and a
context-shaped filler from the bridge only when nothing has been said for two
seconds. Change `bin/hud-agent.md` with that doc open.

`hud listen` is the loop: it holds a connection open, and when something is said
it asks a model to answer by drawing. Run it in the background of a session where
you want the screen to be answerable out loud.

The pill is also where the answer is spoken. `hud listen` turns every tool call
into a breadcrumb on it (`s "Reading your calendar"`) and the reply's first two
sentences into the last line, and it sends `q <n>` when more than one request
is waiting. A spoken reply is one to two sentences and at most 140 characters,
because the pill holds two lines of 13 point text at 440 points wide and a
panel has less room than an ear. Lead with the answer; the panel carries the
rest. A long answer is not read at all: the model writes it for the panel and
says one line pointing at the hyper bar ("All the info on the Civil War is
ready for you in the hyper bar"), and `hud listen` reads only up to that
sentence. A long block with no such line is cut at `SPOKEN_CAP` words and
"The rest is in the hyper bar." is said instead. The panel's header has the
switch, "Speech off for long answers", on by default; off, the display sends
`e prefer voice long=spoken`, `hud listen` reads everything out and tells the
model on each spoken request not to point at the hyper bar.

Recognition is on-device. Do not add anything that ships audio somewhere.

## Changing something already up

This is the part worth learning, because it is what makes the display feel alive
rather than like a slideshow.

A surface survives your disconnection. Address it again by name and anything you
leave off is kept:

```bash
hud draw <<'EOF'
@ people
c a Sparkline label="Messages this week" points=[31,28,44,39,58,52,88] value="88"
EOF
```

That surface stays in the top right at 400 points wide. The sparkline **changes**
rather than being replaced, and a `Diagram` whose coordinates changed animates
between the two: nodes travel to their new positions.

For anything that updates more than once, bind it and then push data. The
component goes out once and every update after is a single short line:

```bash
hud draw <<'EOF'
@ live at=center w=620 chrome=bare
c s Screen title="BUILD"
c d Diagram aspect=2.2 parts=@/graph
> s d
d /graph [{"t":"node","x":0.2,"y":0.5,"label":"compile"}]
r s
EOF

# later, one line, no component re-sent
printf 'd /graph [{"t":"node","x":0.5,"y":0.5,"label":"compile"}]\n' | hud draw
```

`@/pointer` is the binding. Re-sending a whole component every tick works, costs
far more, and throws away the animation.

## The presence field, and how to judge a change to it

The field is the living edge of the screen: the thing that says the assistant is
here and what it is doing. Seven states, one shader, and the numbers that
separate them live in one table, `Presence.field` in `PresenceField.swift`.

Two pages in `skills/hud/presence/`, both generated by `build-tuner.py` from the
real Metal so neither can drift from what ships:

```bash
python3 skills/hud/presence/build-tuner.py   # writes tuner.html and states.html
```

- **`tuner.html`** is one big field with the palette and the alpha terms on
  sliders. It answers "what should this look like."
- **`states.html`** is all seven at once, each paced at its own fps, with a blur
  slider and a table of which pairs sit too close. It answers "can you tell them
  apart," which is the question that actually decides whether the field works.

Never hand-copy the state table into a preview page. The old one in
`tuner.template.html` drifted to `hearing: 0.38` while the Swift said `0.200`,
so an evening of tuning was spent on a state that does not exist.

### What separates states, in order of how well it works

From the ambient and calm-technology literature, and confirmed by looking at the
seven tiles side by side:

1. **Colour.** The strongest channel by a distance, and preattentive. It is
   spent on exactly three readings and no more: white while it is idle,
   listening or waiting on you, green while it is doing something to your
   machine, red when something failed.
2. **Motion rate.** Works, but only while you are actually watching. A glance
   catches one frame, and in one frame `attentive`, `hearing` and `attention`
   are the same picture. `acting` is the exception, because it breathes on its
   own clock and nothing else does.
3. **Thickness.** The weakest, and for a long time the one asked to do the
   most. `attention` is documented as "the thickest, because this is the one
   that has to be noticed" while sitting 35% above `acting`, and 35% on a
   channel nobody can measure by eye is not what makes those two different.
   The hue is.

So: **spend colour on the states that must be noticed, and do not ask thickness
to carry a distinction on its own.** Two states with the same fps, thickness
within 15%, and no hue difference are one state with two names, and `states.html`
prints that pair in red rather than leaving you to notice it.

The steel palette is what makes that affordable. Every constant in the shader
sits within a few percent of neutral, so the palette itself carries no meaning
at all and the whole colour budget is free for the state to spend. A tint is
one `SIMD4` in `Presence.field`: rgb the body is multiplied by, and how much of
it to take. Steel takes none, `acting` takes 0.60 of a green that breathes
between a quarter and six tenths of that, `done` takes 0.75 of a darker one and
holds still, `failed` takes all of a red.

Two rules hold that together and both are load-bearing:

**The hue goes on the body and never on the hot specular.** A highlight that
takes the object's own colour is the single thing that makes a surface read as
plastic. The shader keeps the blown core neutral and tints everything below it,
which is what a coloured light on steel does.

**Green means something is happening to the machine, not that something is
being considered.** `thinking` is white. Nothing has been done yet, and a
person who cannot tell those apart cannot tell when it is safe to walk away.

### Judge it at the edge of your eye, not in a tab

These live in peripheral vision on a screen somebody is not looking at. Staring
at a bright tile judges the wrong thing. Open `states.html`, turn the blur up,
then look at something else and say out loud which tile just changed.

## Rules

**Do not narrate the panel.** If you drew the chart, do not also describe it in
the terminal. Say what you put up and where, in one line.

**Do not open a surface per fact.** Related things belong in one panel.

**Close what you opened.** `hud close <name>` when they are done. The screen is
theirs.

**Do not invent components or props.** Anything not listed here is dropped
silently by the renderer, so the panel will just be missing that piece and
nothing will tell you.

**Set the ring.** It is the only signal the user has that you are alive, and
it costs one line:

| Line | When | What they see |
| ---- | ---- | ------------- |
| `p thinking` | you took a request and are working out what to do | white, thin, moving fast |
| `p acting` | you are running something on their machine | green, breathing |
| `p done` | it worked | darker green, still |
| `p failed` | it did not | red |
| `p attention` | you are blocked on them | white, thick, two pulses |
| `p dormant` | nothing in flight | nothing at all |
| `p speaking amp=0.6` | the voice is playing; hud-listen sends this itself, twenty times a second, from the level of what it is saying | white, thickness moving with the voice, the same as while they talk |

The pill opens into the conversation panel when clicked: every request and
answer of the session, selectable, with a field to type the next one. A typed
request comes up the socket as `h "<text>" via=typed` and is answered in
writing. `w "<text>"` is the answer so far for that panel, the whole text each
time rather than a delta, and `w "<text>" done=true` closes it; hud-listen
sends these itself from what the model writes, one per sentence. The panel
draws Markdown in full (lists, headings, quotes, tables, fenced code with a
copy button), keeps each tool call (`s "<text>" step=true`, which hud-listen
sends for every tool use) as a folded list of steps under the answer with how
long it took, and gives each answer copy, read aloud and ask-again buttons.
Read aloud comes up as `e say turn text="<answer>"` and hud-listen speaks it.

Send `p acting` before the thing that takes time, not after. A state that
arrives once the work is finished is a state nobody ever saw, and the colour
takes about a second to come up on purpose.

**Get the screen size before placing a mark.** `hud screen`. Coordinates are
points, and a Retina screenshot reports twice that. This is the single easiest
way to put a mark in the wrong place.

**Check `hud status` first** if you have not drawn this session, and `hud open`
if it is not running.

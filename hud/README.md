# Kyber

A layer of glass over your whole screen that an AI agent can draw on.

Not a window. Not a browser. One transparent, click-through panel covering the
display, rendering native SwiftUI, that an agent writes to over a Unix socket
while you keep working underneath it.

```bash
printf '@ hi at=topRight\nc s Screen title="HELLO"\nr s\n' | nc -U ~/.bob/hud.sock
```

## Why this exists

Every generative UI system renders to HTML, because HTML is what a model already
knows how to emit and what a browser already knows how to draw. That choice
decides everything downstream: your generated interface lives in a tab, so it
cannot float over your work, cannot mark a region of your screen, cannot show you
a real PDF, and cannot be glanced at while you do something else.

Render the same stream as native views and all of that becomes possible. There is
no bundle, no WebView, no page. The model authors an interface and it appears on
your screen, over whatever you were already doing.

## What it can draw

**Dashboards.** `Sparkline`, `Bars`, `Ring`, `Events`, `Metric`, `Table`,
`Status`, laid out in stacks or a grid. No axes, no gridlines, no legends: the
number is printed beside the shape, so the drawing carries the trend and the text
carries the value. Metrics and rings colour themselves when a value crosses a
threshold you gave them.

**Diagrams.** A free-form vector vocabulary in a unit square: nodes, boxes,
lines, arrows, circles, labels. It is the escape hatch for the case nobody
anticipated, and it is geometry rather than code on purpose. Nothing in a diagram
can execute, fetch, or escape, because none of it is a program.

**Files.** `File path="~/Downloads/resume.pdf"` shows the actual document. PDFs
render through the system's own PDF engine, images as images, text as text, and
editable text writes back to that exact path.

**Marks on the screen itself.** `m bug 420 260 380 90 label="This is the one
failing"` draws corner brackets around a region of your display with a label. Not
a panel near your work: a mark on it. Marks decay, because one that outlives what
it described teaches you to disbelieve all of them.

**Presence.** A ring in the corner and a field round the edge of the screen,
with eight states between them, so you can tell whether it is listening,
thinking, running something, finished or stuck without looking directly at it.
Colour carries three of those and nothing else: white while it waits, green
while it is doing something to your machine, red when that failed.

**Live controls.** Buttons, fields, selects and checkboxes that write to the
panel's own data model at once and send an event back up the socket, so they
respond at typing speed whether or not an agent is still listening.

## Surfaces are not windows

```
@ figure at=center chrome=bare
```

`chrome=bare` draws no panel at all. The content sits directly on your screen
with a halo behind it for legibility. `bracket` puts corner marks around a region
without covering it. `card` is frosted glass and the default.

## Things change rather than being redrawn

A surface outlives the connection that drew it, so addressing it again by name
updates it in place, and anything you leave off is kept. Send a component with
new numbers and it animates: a metric's digits roll, bars grow, and a diagram's
nodes travel to their new positions rather than cutting.

For anything that updates more than once, bind it and push data:

```
c d Diagram aspect=2.2 parts=@/graph
d /graph [{"t":"node","x":0.2,"y":0.5,"label":"A"}]
d /graph [{"t":"node","x":0.6,"y":0.5,"label":"A"}]
```

The second line moves the node. One line, no component re-sent.

## Asking for something

Two front doors, and both produce the same event, so whatever is listening
handles them the same way.

**Option-Space** opens a command bar: one line, centred, a third of the way down.
It shows what the assistant can already see before you type a word, which is the
point of it. Not Command-Space, which is Spotlight, and not Option-Command-Space,
which hides the glass.

**The talk key**, held, listens: the globe, or right Option, Command or Control
from the menu bar for a keyboard without one. Recognition is on-device and the
microphone is off until you turn it on from the menu bar; a Mac whose dictation
is off is told which setting to turn on. Pressed twice quickly, the key is the
way out: the panel, the microphone, a run in flight and the glass all go.
Pressed by accident, with nothing said into it, the band leaves on its own three
seconds later. "Sound when heard" in the menu adds a short tone on release;
it is off unless you turn it on.

The recogniser expects the names in `~/.bob/names.txt`, which `hud listen`
writes from Messages and Contacts, and `~/.bob/vocabulary.txt`, which is yours.

Either way the display sends `h "what they asked for"` up the socket. It holds no
model and no key: something else has to be listening and answer by drawing.

`hud listen`, in the Chewbacca kit, is the loop that turns those events into
drawings.

## Taking your screen back

Escape clears the glass. Option-Command-Space hides and shows it. `-` on its own
does the same over the socket, so nothing needs a permission to put the display
away: drawing on your screen should never be cheaper than clearing it.

Panels and marks can also expire on their own with `life=`, and marks do by
default, because an annotation that outlives what it described teaches you to
disbelieve all of them.

## The wire

Every line is one op, and a line is either complete or invisible, so a
half-written line never draws a half-built panel.

```
@ <surface> [at=region] [w=380] [urgency=alert] [chrome=bare] [life=60]
c <id> <Type> prop=value ...
> <parent> <child> ...
d /pointer <json>
r <id>
- <surface>
p <state> [amp=0.4]
m <id> <x> <y> <w> <h> [label="..."] [tone=bad] [life=30]
u [<id>]
```

Nothing paints until `r`. `c` and `>` may arrive in any order, so a child can be
sent before its parent. Anything the renderer does not recognise is dropped
rather than drawn wrong.

## Is it any good

The interfaces a model builds out of this catalog are tested, which is the part
of generative UI nobody has been able to do. `eval/hud.eval.ts` runs seven
scenarios three times each and measures not only whether the assertions pass but
how much the answer *moves* between runs.

That distinction is the whole point, and it earned its keep immediately. The
diagram scenario passed every assertion — rendered three times out of three,
used a `Diagram` three times out of three — and still failed, because its
stability was 0.31. Three correct diagrams, three different diagrams, which is
exactly what people mean when they say a generated interface destroys the
familiarity they had built. An assertion-only harness reports that as three
green runs.

The cause was in the catalog, not the model: nothing said how to arrange a
drawing. Given a convention, it went to 1.00 and the suite got roughly twice as
fast, because a model that knows the arrangement stops inventing one.

```
7/7 scenarios pass, every one at stability 1.00
```

## Seeing it without a screen

A heads-up display is the hardest kind of UI to review, because looking at it
needs a machine somebody is sitting at, unlocked, with the right things already
behind it. `SnapshotTests` removes all of that: `ImageRenderer` turns each
surface into pixels, so the interface is reviewable from a terminal or a build
server.

Every surface is drawn twice, over a light page and a dark one, because the one
thing this UI cannot control is what is behind it. The assertion is that a
meaningful share of the pixels changed, which sounds crude and is the one that
matters: a view rendering nothing is pixel-identical to its backdrop, and
"renders nothing" is this project's favourite failure. A `matchedGeometryEffect`
once blanked the entire display and was caught only because somebody happened to
take a screenshot.

```bash
HUD_SNAPSHOT_DIR=/tmp/shots swift test   # keeps the PNGs
```

It found three things on its first run: markers whose visibility depended on an
async task having fired, edges in a diagram that vanished into a page of black
text, and a caption sitting inside the region it was supposed to be labelling.

## Building it

```bash
swift build
swift test          # 70 tests
./scripts/bundle.sh # produces build/Kyber.app
```

macOS 14 or later. No dependencies.

## What it cannot do

[1000 ways it falls short](docs/1000-WAYS-IT-FALLS-SHORT.md) is an audit of the
working build: what you cannot do, what is wrong, and what is right by accident.
Seven of the thousand are marked as deliberate with the reasoning given, because
a list that cannot tell a decision from a defect is not an audit.

What is left is filed as work in the backlog and tracked in
`bd`. The audit stays as the record of what was wrong.

The list is here rather than only in a tracker because a heads-up display fails
quietly. It draws something, you glance at it, and you never find out what it
left out.

## Design notes

The comments in `Sources/KyberKit` explain the reasoning rather than the syntax,
and most of them exist because something was wrong first. A few worth knowing:

- The window ignores mouse events by default and only becomes solid where a
  surface actually is. Returning nil from `hitTest` passes clicks through but not
  scroll, which silently ate every scroll on the display.
- `NSHostingView` is a single `NSView`. SwiftUI creates no child views, so a
  `hitTest` that compares against `self` cannot tell a button from a gap.
- A `Canvas` cannot sample what is behind the window, so anything that needs to
  be glass has to be a real view.
- A `View` may conform to `Animatable`, which is what lets a diagram morph: the
  canvas reads its coordinates out of `animatableData` and redraws along the path
  between two drawings instead of cutting between them.
- The socket accepts several clients at once. It used to read one connection to
  completion before accepting the next, which meant that starting the loop that
  lets you talk to the display stopped every other client from drawing on it,
  with no error and no timeout.

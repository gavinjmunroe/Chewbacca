# Jev in the HUD

How the HUD uses TypeSafe's Jev to run many agents and act faster, step by step
against Movez's "Jev Engineering: how to build the fastest AI Agent Brain in 10
Steps" (2026-09-18). Started 2026-09-23. The wider plan, beyond the HUD, is
[JEV-EVERYWHERE.md](JEV-EVERYWHERE.md).

The rule the whole plan follows, from the article: **if an operation creates text,
it stays with the LLM. If it picks from a list, scores, or answers yes or no, it
goes to Jev. An exact rule goes in code.** A Jev answer comes back well inside a
voice turn's budget, so a decision stops being the slow part of it.

## Where each step lands

| Step            | In the HUD                                                                                                                                                            | Status                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 01 Split        | The decisions in `hud-listen` today: where a sentence goes, which agent it is for, whether a prompt is safe, whether to speak or write the answer, what to click next | Inventory below          |
| 02 Playground   | `tests/eval_*_jev.py`: labelled sentences against the live API before any code trusts a threshold                                                                     | Two evals exist          |
| 03 SDK          | `bin/lib/jev.py`: one HTTP call, None on any failure so rules still work when Jev is down                                                                             | Done                     |
| 04 Handoff      | The agent board: every Claude session's state, folded from hook events (`agent-events.jsonl`)                                                                         | Built, see below         |
| 05 Questions    | Choice for destination and agent, Noul for safety and "is this a status question", Score for urgency                                                                  | Choice in use            |
| 06 Dynamic menu | `agent_board.menu` rebuilds the agent list from the live board on every call; guide mode does the same with the controls on screen                                    | Agents built, guide next |
| 07 Parallel     | One call per sentence carrying every question: destination, agent, status question, urgency                                                                           | Next                     |
| 08 Guardrails   | Floors under every choice (below them the voice asks), a safety Noul in front of permission answers, a spend cap, outcome checked separately from the decision        | Floors built             |
| 09 Cost         | Per-call cost and latency logged with each `turn:` line in listen.log                                                                                                 | Next                     |
| 10 Deploy       | Voice router tier 3 (live), agent picking, permission triage, guide mode, compaction                                                                                  | Rolling out              |

## The decisions (step 01)

| Decision                                                | Today                          | Jev question                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Where does a sentence go (terminal, browser, assistant) | Word lists, then Jev tier 3    | Choice, live since 2026-09-23                              |
| Which agent is it for                                   | Choice over the live board     | Choice over the live board, wired to the voice 2026-09-23   |
| Is it asking for status rather than giving an order     | Phrase match, board answers    | Noul, later, if the phrase match misses real questions      |
| Is a waiting permission prompt safe to allow            | Only the person, by voice      | Noul, used to rank and phrase the ask, never to grant alone |
| Speak the answer or write it to the hyper bar           | Length rule                    | Choice, later                                               |
| What to click next in guide mode                        | Word match on control names    | Choice over the controls on screen, rebuilt every step      |
| Which tool calls to keep when compacting a long session | Nothing                        | Score per call (fast-jev-compaction's approach)             |

## What is built

- `bin/lib/agent_board.py`: fold, expire, order (waiting, then running, then done),
  the spoken summary, the dynamic menu, and `pick`. One session means no Jev call.
  Below `PICK_FLOOR` or on "none", nobody gets the sentence and the voice asks which.
- `mac/lib/terminal_events.py`: the hook now writes every session to
  `agent-events.jsonl`. Only the remembered tab's prompts are held, as before.
- `bin/agents`: `agents`, `agents say`, `agents pick "<words>"`, `agents --json`.
- `tests/test_agent_board.py` (21 checks) and two new checks in
  `tests/test_terminal_events.py`.
- `tests/eval_agent_board_jev.py`: the live eval. Its results stay private,
  because TypeSafe's agreement (2.3(f)) bars publishing Jev performance results.
- **Topics on the menu** (2026-09-23). Each board line carries the session's
  transcript path, and the board reads the newest `ai-title` Claude Code writes
  there. No UserPromptSubmit hook needed. The voice names a session by it.
- **Tabs.** The hook finds each session's Terminal tty once, from the claude
  process above it, and caches it in `agent-ttys/<session>`. Only a session with
  a tab can be typed into or answered.
- **Voice wiring** (2026-09-23), in `hud-listen`:
  - "What are my agents doing" (`route.agent_status_word`) speaks the board,
    minus the voice's own session. No model turn.
  - A terminal-bound sentence goes to the one tab there is, or to the one
    `pick` chooses, drafted with `--tty`. Below the floor the voice asks
    "Which one: A or B?" and hears the next sentence (within 30 s) as the answer.
  - Yes and no answer the remembered tab's held prompt as before; otherwise the
    one board session waiting in a tab, by key press. Several waiting: it says
    who and presses nothing. Prompts older than 15 minutes are left alone.

## Next, in order

1. **Announce other sessions' prompts.** Only the remembered tab's permission
   prompts are spoken and held. Others are heard only through the status question.
   Tail `agent-events.jsonl` in hud-listen and speak a new wait, rate-limited.
2. **"Yes to rig."** An answer that names the session, for when several wait.
3. **One parallel call.** Fold the router's destination question and the agent question
   into one `jev.ask` with both, so a sentence costs one round trip.
4. **Permission triage.** A Noul per waiting prompt, "safe to allow without review",
   used to order what the voice reads out and to say "three safe, one risky". It never
   grants: the only allow stays one a person said.
5. **Guide mode on Jev.** `hud-guide` lists the controls; Jev picks the next one from
   that list instead of word matching. Same loop Browser Use ships.
6. **Cost line.** Log tokens and seconds per Jev call next to each `turn:` line.

## Hard lines

- Jev never grants a permission and never sends text anywhere on its own. It picks,
  scores and ranks; code and the person act.
- Every threshold carries the eval run that set it. A floor with no run behind it
  says so in its comment.
- Personal text (messages, mail) may go to Jev: Gavin chose full access on
  2026-09-23, with Karthik's permission for the Amber side. `PEOPLE_JEV=off` and
  `HUD_CLASSIFY_JEV=off` still switch it off.

"""handoff-check: refuse a reply that hands the user something to run.

do-it-yourself.md is ALWAYS ON and Caleb still had to say it twice in one
night. A rule that does not fire is not a rule, so these cases are the rule
turned into something that executes.

The false-positive cases matter more than the true positives. A guard that
fires on correct replies gets switched off, and then it protects nothing.

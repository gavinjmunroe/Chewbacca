"""Where a spoken sentence goes: terminal, browser, or the assistant.

Pure. Takes the sentence, what is in front of the person, and a memory dict,
and answers with a destination and why. Three tiers, cheapest first:
a correction of the last decision, then rules, then whatever HUD_CLASSIFY_CMD
names for what the rules cannot settle, and the assistant when nothing does.
The design and the evidence for each rule are in
the voice-routing design notes.

Tier 3 is TypeSafe's Jev (`classify_with_jev`), because it answers in a
quarter of a second where the Haiku CLI took 9 to 17. The frontmost
application is a prior here and not a destination: `_work_shaped` is the gate
that made it one, and `_classify_cmd` carries the measurement that switched
the CLI call off. `summarize` still runs the CLI, under a budget that can
afford it.

# WHOSE work is this?
#
# Volume noise was fixed twice above. Authorship noise was never fixed at all.
# On 2026-09-21 this hook reported "4 uncommitted changes" for files a SECOND
# live session had written seconds earlier, and told the reader to commit them.
# Acting on that absorbs another session's in-flight work into your commit,
# which is the exact failure .githooks/pre-commit and .claude/hooks/write-log.sh
# were both written to catch. Warning someone toward a trap the rest of the kit
# then springs on them is worse than saying nothing.
#
# So attribute the dirty tracked files before reporting them. write-log.tsv
# holds "epoch<TAB>session_id<TAB>absolute path". Everything here degrades to
# the previous behaviour when the log is missing, empty, unreadable, or when
# jq is absent, because a guard that suppresses a real warning on a bad day is
# worse than one that occasionally repeats itself.
# Attribute exactly the set DIRTY_COUNT counted, not a narrower one. An
# untracked file another session created is staged by `git add -A` like any
# other, so leaving it out reported a mixed tree as clean-handed. When the
# untracked entries were dropped as environment noise above, drop them here too,
# which also bounds this loop to tracked + UNTRACKED_NOISE_FLOOR greps.

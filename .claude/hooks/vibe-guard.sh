# Stop hook: refuse a reply that asserts a verified state without evidence.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. 2026-09-21, after a ten hour portal session: "We good to
# close this tab? Don't answer that based on vibes. Fix chewbacca so it never
# answers anything based on vibes."
#
# The question was fair. Across that session:
#
#   a fix was reported as done three separate times and the next screenshot
#   showed the same bug, because the claim was checked against the code's
#   arithmetic instead of against the running screen
#
#   several rounds of "fixed" were claimed while the code path in question
#   was not executing at all, because a texture upload failed silently and
#   the old path took over with nothing in any log to say so
#
#   a commit message overstated a measurement, and the correction had to come
#   from the user rather than from the check
#
# None of those were dishonesty. They were claims made from a model of the
# system rather than from an observation of it, and nothing in the loop could
# tell the difference. This can.
#
# WHAT IT ENFORCES, narrowly, because a guard that fires on ordinary sentences
# gets disabled within a day:
#
#   1. "safe to close", "good to close" and the like need a closeout receipt
#      that passed, recently, against the commits that are checked out now.
#
#   2. "fixed", "it works now", "verified", "tests pass" need a command to
#      have RUN in this session after the last file was written. Editing a
#      file and then describing what the edit will do is the exact shape of
#      every wrong claim above.
#
# Exit 2 blocks the turn and hands the reason back. Exit 0 says nothing.
# Advisory hooks do nothing: slop-guard once exited 0 with an unrecognised
# JSON field and twelve sloppy replies shipped before anyone noticed.

vibe-guard: this reply says it is safe to close, and there is no evidence for
that: $WHY.

"Safe to close" is a factual claim about uncommitted work, unpushed commits,
whether the gates pass, and whether the lesson got written down. All of those
are decidable. Run it and answer from what it prints:

  cd ~/Desktop/2026-Code/projects/chewbacca && bin/closeout

If it fails, say what failed. If it passes, say so and name the commits.

vibe-guard: this reply claims something is fixed, verified or passing, and
nothing ran after the last file was written to show that.

Editing a file and then describing what the edit does is a prediction. On
2026-09-21 that shape produced three "fixed" claims the next screenshot
disproved, and several more while the code path being described was not even
executing.

Run the thing and report what it printed: the build, the test, a grep of the
shipped bundle for the symbol, a screenshot of the moment being described.
Or drop the claim and say what was changed instead.

the last file was written.

A file changed and no build, test, run or read came after it, so the reply is
describing what the edit should do rather than what it did. Run the check that
applies and report what it printed. If no check applies to this change, say so
plainly and stop again.

"""Live eval of Jev tagging `people note` against the keyword fallback. Hits
the network, so it is not part of the suite. Needs TYPESAFE_API_KEY or the
Keychain entry.

    python3 tests/eval_people_jev.py

Each case runs `people note` end to end in a throwaway PEOPLE_DIR, once with
Jev and once with PEOPLE_JEV=off, and reads back what was stored. Names are
fictional; the sentences have the shape of notes the skill writes. Labelled by
hand on 2026-09-23. Dimensions count as right when the stored set equals the
label; modality and source must match exactly.

Scores stay private: TypeSafe's customer agreement (2.3(f)) bars publishing
Jev performance results. Hard cases worth keeping: "a church in Austin",
"apparently engaged", "I think she is struggling".

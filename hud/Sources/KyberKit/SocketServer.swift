/// A Unix domain socket carrying Kyber Lines in, and events back out.
///
/// A socket rather than a port because there is nothing to configure, nothing to
/// collide with, and the filesystem already has the permission model: a socket in
/// the user's own directory is reachable by that user and nobody else. A panel
/// that renders whatever is sent to it should not be listening on the network.
///
/// The channel is bidirectional on purpose. A display that cannot answer is a
/// poster: you can look at it and that is all. Sending events back on the same
/// connection is what lets an agent ask a question, draw the options, and find
/// out which one was picked, without a second transport or a polling loop.
///
/// Several connections at once, because the design needs it.
///
/// This used to accept one client and then block reading it until it hung up,
/// which quietly broke the whole system the moment anything stayed connected. A
/// listening loop holds its connection open for the life of the session, so with
/// one running, every `hud draw` sat in the accept queue and drew nothing: no
/// error, no timeout, just a command that appeared to succeed and did nothing.
///
/// Each connection now gets its own reader, and events go to all of them. The
/// race that the single-client rule was guarding against is settled by surfaces
/// being addressable by name: two writers to different names cannot collide, and
/// two writers to the same name were always going to fight whatever this did.

"""Every Claude Code session on the machine, folded from the hook's events.

`terminal_state` keeps one state for the remembered tab. This keeps one per
session, from `agent-events.jsonl`, which the hook writes for every session
whatever its folder. It is what lets one voice run many agents: the board says
who is running, who is waiting on you, who is done, and `pick` asks Jev which
of them a spoken sentence is for.

The option list Jev chooses from is rebuilt from the live board on every call,
never cached: a session that ended a second ago must not be choosable
(Movez, "Jev Engineering" step 06, research/jev-engineering in the brain).
Exact rules stay in code: with one session there is nothing to decide, so Jev
is not called.

A session's topic is the `ai-title` Claude Code writes into its own transcript
("Kyber terminal and agent communication"), read from the transcript's tail.
The folder alone could not tell two sessions in one repo apart: the eval's one
miss, "the heads up display one", was a session the menu only knew as
`Chewbacca`.

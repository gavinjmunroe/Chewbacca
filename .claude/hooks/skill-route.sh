# THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR, 2026-09-21. Caleb: "Chewbacca's resourcefulness
# and use of agents is so retarded didn't we build a whole graph engineering
# knowledge base bruh". He was right. A session had just hand-written two
# subagent prompts with no verifier and no stop rule, and had run GROUP BY over
# a million-row people-and-orgs file, while skills/graph-engineering sat in the
# repo holding both: a task-graph reference whose first rule is that the
# verification node is non-negotiable, and a nine-stage pipeline whose stage 8
# is the exact deduplication problem the client had called hard.
#
# Thirty-two skills were installed. Zero were named. kit-route.sh routes to
# KITS and was never registered either, so nothing on the machine ever pointed
# at a skill when work started.
#
# Every SKILL.md already carries a description written to be routed on:
# skill-scan spends 25 of its 100 points on "will the description route to this
# skill at all". The descriptions were fine. Nothing read them.
#
# Same contract as kit-route.sh: deterministic, model-free, silent unless there
# is a real match. Silence is the common case and costs nothing. A router that
# speaks on every prompt is one that gets tuned out inside a week, which is the
# failure it exists to prevent.

# Extensions: skills, plugins, and MCP

The commands and rules in this repo were the whole story in early 2026. They are not anymore.
Claude Code now loads capability from three separate places, and they solve different problems.
Installing all three is what `setup.sh` does.

| Layer    | Lives in                | Loads              | Good for                                              |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Rules    | `~/.claude/rules/`      | On matching files  | Standards you want enforced without asking            |
| Commands | `~/.claude/commands/`   | When you type `/x` | Multi-step procedures you run by name                 |
| Skills   | `~/.claude/skills/`     | On matching intent | Deep domain knowledge too long to keep in context     |
| Plugins  | `claude plugin install` | On matching intent | Skills plus MCP servers plus subagents, versioned     |
| MCP      | `.mcp.json`             | Always             | Live connections to services that hold your real data |

A rule is a paragraph Claude reads. A skill is a directory Claude opens only when the task calls
for it, so a 40KB reference costs nothing until the moment it is relevant. A plugin bundles skills,
MCP servers, and subagents behind one install command and one version number.

## Skills

### Shipped in this repo

**`skills/stack-rules/`** holds twelve stack-specific standards: components, api,
database, deployment, design, performance, state, accessibility, scroll-effects,
testing, ux-laws, and audit. They used to sit in `.claude/rules/` alongside the
universal six, where nothing loaded them at all: `CLAUDE.md` had no `@` imports
and no other mechanism read that directory, so all eighteen installed and then
did nothing.

The six universal ones (git, security, writing, naming, typescript,
review-discipline) are now `@`-imported by `CLAUDE.md` at about 3,700 tokens.
The other twelve became this skill because importing all eighteen costs roughly
16,000 tokens on every session, and a Python service that will never render a
component should not pay for the Tailwind rules.

Install: `cp -R skills/stack-rules ~/.claude/skills/` (both installers do this).

**`skills/graph-engineering/`** teaches both halves of graph work: knowledge graphs (ontology
design, entity and relation extraction, fusion, GraphRAG) and task graphs (parallel fan-out,
verifier separation, stop rules, human gates). The knowledge-graph half is distilled and translated
from Southeast University's graduate Knowledge Graph course
([npubird/KnowledgeGraphCourse](https://github.com/npubird/KnowledgeGraphCourse)). In teaching mode
it explains each stage with worked examples and generates diagrams.

Install: `cp -R skills/graph-engineering ~/.claude/skills/`

### Installed from upstream

**[petergyang/no-ai-slop](https://github.com/petergyang/no-ai-slop)** (MIT) removes 20+ patterns of
AI slop from a draft: binary contrasts, throat-clearing, faux-insight setups, colon reveals,
fake-profound kickers, importance puffery. It has a detect-only mode that flags patterns without
rewriting, which is the one to use on someone else's prose.

`setup.sh` clones it rather than vendoring a copy, so it stays updatable and keeps its own license.

Worth knowing: the skill is for editing drafts on request. If you want the rules applied to
everything Claude writes by default, put the pattern list in your `CLAUDE.md` as a standing
instruction. The skill and the standing rule do different jobs.

**[conorbronsdon/avoid-ai-writing](https://github.com/conorbronsdon/avoid-ai-writing)** (MIT) is the
deepest of the three: 61 pattern categories, a 112-entry word replacement table across three
severity tiers, and `rewrite` / `detect` / `edit`-in-place modes with an optional voice profile. It
also ships a deterministic Node detector (`detector/patterns.js`, `npm test`, `scripts/self-scan.js`)
that runs with no model at all, so it can gate a docs directory in CI. Its own docs are candid that
these patterns are signals rather than proof: published audits put commercial AI-detector
false-positive rates above 60% on non-native English writers, so it flags and explains rather than
convicting.

**[blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer)** (MIT) works from a different catalogue,
Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing," which is why it is worth having alongside the other two rather
than instead of them. It catches inflated symbolism, rule-of-three padding, negative parallelism,
vague attribution, and em dash rate. It installs as a plugin, so it updates with
`claude plugin update humanizer`.

### Which of the three to reach for

They overlap enough that running all three on one draft mostly wastes tokens.

| Situation                                         | Use                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quick pass on your own draft, voice preserved     | `no-ai-slop`                                                      |
| Thorough audit, or a file edited in place         | `avoid-ai-writing`                                                |
| Second opinion after one of the above looks clean | `humanizer`, since its pattern list comes from a different source |
| Gating docs in CI with no model in the loop       | `avoid-ai-writing`'s Node detector                                |

## MCP servers the installer sets up

Curated from [mcpmarket.com](https://mcpmarket.com), which catalogs a bit over 46,000 servers. The
list below is small on purpose: every entry was checked against the npm or PyPI registry, so none of
them is a squatted package name. Two of mcpmarket's own most-engaged entries did not survive that
check, which is the argument for doing it.

They install in two tiers, and the difference is whether you need an account.

The first tier needs no account and installs outright. These work the moment `setup.sh`
finishes.

| Server                | Runs                                            | What you get                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `git`                 | `uvx mcp-server-git`                            | Repo reads, searches, and commits as calls   |
| `chrome-devtools`     | `npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest`                | Drive a real Chrome by DOM, not by pixels    |

**`chrome-devtools` is the one worth knowing about.** Everything else here is a
data source; this one gives the agent hands on a browser. It reads the page as a
DOM snapshot and clicks elements by id, so it is not screenshot-and-guess, and it
can attach to a Chrome you are already signed into with `--browserUrl`.

That last part is the point. Anything behind a login (a repo's settings page, a
dashboard, a console with no API) is otherwise a dead end that ends in "run this
command yourself". Two warnings from getting this wrong: pixel automation on a
browser the user is actively typing in will fight them for the keyboard, and a
DOM snapshot id goes stale on any re-render, so re-snapshot after every step
rather than reusing an id.

The second tier is mcpmarket's Official row, and each one is installed only when its key is
already exported.

| Server        | Variables                                        | Key from                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `exa`         | `EXA_API_KEY`                                    | dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys |
| `tavily`      | `TAVILY_API_KEY`                                 | app.tavily.com            |
| `firecrawl`   | `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`                              | firecrawl.dev             |
| `elevenlabs`  | `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`                             | elevenlabs.io             |
| `browserbase` | `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY`, `BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID`  | browserbase.com           |
| `magic`       | `TWENTY_FIRST_API_KEY`                           | 21st.dev/magic            |

`claude mcp add` will register a server whose key is missing, and then every call it makes fails.
That is worse than the server being absent, because the agent keeps reaching for a tool that cannot
work. So a keyed server is skipped, by name, with the variable it wanted:

```
  warn browserbase skipped, needs: BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID
```

To add one later, export the variable and re-run that section. It is idempotent, so a server already
registered is left alone:

```bash
export TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-...
./setup.sh --only plugins
```

To change the catalog, edit `KIT_MCP` in [tools/inventory.py](../tools/inventory.py) and run
`python3 tools/inventory.py`. It rewrites the README table, this installer block, and
`config/settings/toolkit.json` together. Hand-editing any of the three loses the edit on the next run.

## MCP servers you host yourself

**[linshenkx/prompt-optimizer](https://github.com/linshenkx/prompt-optimizer)** (AGPL-3.0) rewrites
and iterates on prompts, exposing `optimize-user-prompt`, `optimize-system-prompt`, and
`iterate-prompt` over MCP. Run it as a container and point Claude Code at it:

```bash
docker run -d --name prompt-optimizer --restart unless-stopped -p 8081:80 \
  -e VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key \
  -e MCP_DEFAULT_MODEL_PROVIDER=openai \
  linshen/prompt-optimizer:latest

claude mcp add --transport http prompt-optimizer http://localhost:8081/mcp --scope user
```

It calls a model provider directly, so it needs its own key. Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works,
including a local Ollama, which makes it free to run:

```bash
  -e VITE_CUSTOM_API_KEY=ollama \
  -e VITE_CUSTOM_API_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1 \
  -e VITE_CUSTOM_API_MODEL=llama3.1:8b \
  -e MCP_DEFAULT_MODEL_PROVIDER=custom
```

Two things to know. The tools go dead when the container is not running, so `--restart unless-stopped`
is doing real work. And the license is AGPL-3.0: running it as a separate service is fine, copying its
source into your own project is not.

## Plugins

Three marketplaces cover everything below.

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-plugins-official
claude plugin marketplace add Egonex-AI/Understand-Anything
claude plugin marketplace add blader/humanizer
```

**[Understand-Anything](https://github.com/Egonex-AI/Understand-Anything)** turns a codebase into an
interactive knowledge graph you can explore, search, and ask questions about. It ships subagents for
architecture analysis, domain extraction, and tour building, plus `/understand`, `/understand-chat`,
`/understand-diff`, and a web dashboard. Useful on a repo you did not write, or one you wrote six
months ago.

From the official marketplace:

| Plugin                    | What it gives you                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `serena`                  | Symbol-level code navigation and editing across a project              |
| `playwright`              | Browser automation for testing UI and scraping                         |
| `vercel`                  | Deploy, env vars, AI SDK, Next.js guidance                             |
| `railway`                 | Services, databases, environments, deploy troubleshooting              |

context7, expo, pinecone, bigquery-data-analytics and the fetch, time, sequential-thinking and
chart servers were dropped from the default install on 2026-10-05. Two weeks of transcripts on a
machine that had all of them showed zero calls, and every installed tool is paid for in context on
every session. Install one by hand when a project needs it.

Supabase is not on that list on purpose. It is wired as an MCP server in `.mcp.json` rather than a
plugin, because what you want from it is a live connection to your actual project, not packaged
guidance. Same reasoning for `filesystem` and `github`.

## Order of operations

Reach for the lightest thing that works.

1. A rule, if it is a standard you want applied silently
2. A command, if it is a procedure you invoke by name
3. A skill, if it is knowledge too large to keep loaded
4. A plugin, if someone already built and versioned it
5. An MCP server, if it needs live data from a running service

Writing a skill for something an installed plugin already does is wasted work. Writing a rule when a one-line
`CLAUDE.md` sentence would do is worse, because rules files are another thing to keep current.

## Verifying what is installed

```bash
claude plugin list
ls ~/.claude/skills/
ls ~/.claude/rules/ ~/.claude/commands/
```

Plugins that need OAuth (Vercel, Railway, Supabase, and the like) install fine but stay inert until
you authorize them. Run `/mcp` in an interactive session to finish that; a headless run cannot do
the browser handoff.

/// Listening.
///
/// The display could already draw anything and there was no way to ask it for
/// anything without a terminal, which makes it a rendering target rather than an
/// assistant. The spec's first property is zero invocation cost: the cost of
/// engaging should be the cost of speaking, and every click between wanting help
/// and getting it is a tax that kills the behaviour.
///
/// Recognition is pinned on-device. That is not only a privacy position, though
/// it is that: a HUD that ships audio to a server cannot be left listening in a
/// room where other people are talking, and one that cannot be left listening is
/// one you have to remember to turn on, which is the tax again.
///
/// Two modes, because they answer different objections:
///
/// - **Push to talk** needs no wake word, no continuous audio, and no trust. Hold
///   a key, speak, release.
/// - **Wake** listens continuously and acts only on an utterance containing the
///   wake word. It is what the films depict and it costs a microphone that is
///   always open, so it is opt-in and it says so in the menu.
///
/// What was heard is shown before it is acted on. Every revision the recogniser
/// makes goes out as `.partial` while the person is still talking, and the turn
/// closes as one `.heard`: on the final, or on the last partial once
/// `commitGrace` has passed since the key came up, whichever lands first. The
/// turn counter is what makes the second arrival inert.

/// The object the pill and every card are made of: a slab of glass with a
/// thickness, lit from one side, standing off the screen.
///
/// The ask on 2026-09-22 was "more 3d and translucent". A flat tint with a
/// gradient border reads as a decal however clear it is, and macOS 15 has no
/// lens to borrow, so the depth is drawn. Five things make it, each one a cue
/// the eye already uses on real glass:
///
/// - a bevel: the inner edge lit where the light enters and shadowed where
///   the slab turns away, which is what says it has a thickness at all;
/// - a gloss band across the upper half, the reflection of a light above;
/// - a specular point that follows the pointer, so the object answers the
///   hand before it is clicked;
/// - a caustic, the presence colour pooling along the bottom edge the way
///   light gathers where a lens is thickest;
/// - two shadows, a tight contact one and a wide ambient one, because a single
///   soft shadow reads as a glow and not as height.
///
/// - dispersion: a faint blue and red split along the edge, the way glass
///   separates white light;
/// - the content floating a point above it, with its own small shadow, so the
///   glass reads as a layer behind the words.
///
/// The light in it follows the assistant (`hudEnergy`), and the thickness
/// follows urgency (`Urgency.thickness`): the glass says how awake and how
/// loud before a word on it is read.
///
/// Under the pointer the glass leans toward it, the words shift a pixel or
/// two against the lean, and the specular point follows. All of it is a
/// function of where the pointer is and nothing else: hold still and nothing
/// moves. The words themselves are never rotated; see `body`.

<#
Chewbacca on Windows: the one line you paste.

  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calebnewtonusc/Chewbacca/main/start.ps1 | iex"

Written for the person this kit is actually being sold to: someone with a
laptop, a lot of people to keep track of, and no idea what a package manager
is. Two things it deliberately does differently from the macOS installer:

  1. It installs nothing outside your user folder. No admin prompt, no
     Homebrew equivalent, no PATH surgery beyond one user-level entry. On
     Windows an installer that asks for administrator is an installer most
     people close.
  2. It is honest about what does not work here. Half of this kit drives macOS
     through Accessibility, and none of that half runs on Windows. What does
     run is the part that makes the agent know you, which is the part being
     demoed: the standards, the skills, the commands and the subagents.

It asks nothing. Everything it needs it detects or defaults.

  Chewbacca
  Makes the AI you already pay for a lot better at your actual life.

  Before anything runs, here is exactly what this does:

    It writes to two folders inside your user account, and nowhere else:
      $CbHome
      $Claude

    It does NOT ask for administrator, install system software, change
    Windows settings, or touch anything outside your user folder.

    It uploads nothing. Every file it writes stays on this machine.

    To remove all of it later, delete those two folders.

  On Windows you get the part that makes the agent know you: the standards,
  the skills, the slash commands and the subagents. The macOS automation half
  of this kit (screen reading, sending texts, driving apps) does not run here
  and is not installed.

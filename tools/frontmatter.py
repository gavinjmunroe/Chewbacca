"""Check that every SKILL.md frontmatter actually parses.

A skill whose YAML is malformed does not fail loudly. It fails by not being
registered, so the agent never sees it and the user concludes the skill is bad
at triggering. `life-ops` shipped that way: its description read

    description: The half of a week that is not code and not class: appointments, ...

and the unquoted colon makes YAML read `... not class` as a nested key. One
character, and a whole skill is invisible.

No pyyaml on a stock macOS python, so this checks the specific constructs that
break a frontmatter block rather than parsing the general language. That is a
narrower claim and an honest one.

  python3 tools/frontmatter.py                check the repo's skills
  python3 tools/frontmatter.py --installed    check ~/.claude/skills too
  python3 tools/frontmatter.py path/to/skills check any directory of skills

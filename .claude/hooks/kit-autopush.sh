# Stop: push the kit repo's committed work, so a fix never stays on one laptop.
#
# THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR. format-and-sync.sh auto-commits and auto-pushes
# the context store, and d1-config.sh said of the kit itself: "Chewbacca is its
# own repo and is pushed explicitly." Explicitly means a person remembering,
# and the same assumption in sync-chewbacca.sh is why commit cfb8001 sat on
# this machine unpushed until a SessionStart check happened to look. A fix that
# exists only here is a fix nobody else got, and every install pulls from the
# remote.
#
# So the remote is now the default rather than the reward for remembering.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. It never commits. A context store is notes and a
# half-written note is still a note; a code repo mid-session holds a function
# with no caller and a test that does not run yet, and "chore: update file.sh"
# across forty of those is an unreadable history and a broken main. Committing
# stays a deliberate act. stop-check.sh still reports uncommitted work.
#
# WHY IT IS GATED. A push to main runs CI, and an auto-push is exactly the
# push nobody is watching. Shipping a stale SHA256SUMS.txt means the checksums
# published for `curl | bash` are lying, which is worse than not publishing.
# So the cheap half of CI runs here first, locally, in about two seconds. A
# gate that fails blocks the push and says which one and why, and that message
# reaches the session rather than a log nobody opens.

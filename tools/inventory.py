"""Regenerate the Chewbacca inventory from what is installed on this machine.

Run it from anywhere:  python3 tools/inventory.py
It rewrites the generated regions of README.md, setup.sh, and
config/settings/toolkit.json to match the skills, plugins, MCP servers and CLI
tools actually present, so adding a skill updates the repo without anyone
remembering to.

The kit's README table and setup.sh install list used to be hand-maintained, so
every skill or plugin added to the local machine silently made the public repo
wrong. This reads what is actually installed and rewrites the generated regions
of README.md, setup.sh, and config/settings/toolkit.json to match.

What it will publish:
  - skills carrying a .source file (an upstream public repo)
  - skills vendored in the repo's own skills/ directory
  - skills symlinked out of a skill pack in PACKS, grouped into one row
  - plugins from enabledPlugins, with the marketplace they came from
  - the MCP servers in KIT_MCP, which is repo-owned data
  - CLI tools and macOS apps in CLI_TOOLS whose probe finds them installed

What it will never publish:
  - a skill with no .source that is not in the repo (assumed personal)
  - anything at all out of ~/.claude.json. It holds client hostnames and API
    keys, and nothing in this generator reads it.

Exit codes: 0 wrote changes, 1 nothing to do, 2 error.

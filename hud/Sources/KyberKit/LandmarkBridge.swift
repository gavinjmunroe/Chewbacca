/// Turns an Apple Vision hand observation into the 21 landmarks the web
/// portal expects.
///
/// WHY THIS IS NOT MEDIAPIPE. The obvious way to put a hand-tracked portal on
/// the HUD is to load the browser build into a WKWebView and let MediaPipe
/// use the camera. It works, and it is wrong here: it opens a SECOND camera
/// stream next to the one the HUD already runs, pulls a WASM model off a CDN
/// on every launch, and costs several times the CPU. Apple Vision is already
/// in this process and measured at 7.56ms for one hand, 4-6% of one core
/// sustained on an M4 Pro. So Vision produces the landmarks and the web layer
/// only draws.
///
/// WHAT ACTUALLY NEEDS CONVERTING. Very little, which is worth stating
/// because the plan budgeted a day for it:
///
///   * ORDER. Vision's joints, listed wrist, thumb, index, middle, ring,
///     little, already land in MediaPipe's 0-20 order. The mapping is the
///     identity. `HandTracker.allJoints` is that list and `bones` already
///     matches OpenVision's `HAND_CONNECTIONS`.
///   * ORIGIN. This is the whole conversion. Vision normalizes with the
///     origin at the BOTTOM left and y increasing upward. MediaPipe puts the
///     origin at the TOP left with y increasing downward. So y flips and x
///     does not.
///   * DEPTH. Vision's hand pose is 2D. There is no z, and inventing one
///     would be a lie that a caller could not distinguish from a measurement,
///     so z is always 0 and the web side must not depend on it.
///
/// Getting the flip wrong produces a hand that is upside down but plausible,
/// which is the worst kind of bug to find by waving at a laptop, so the
/// conversion is a pure function with tests rather than two characters buried
/// in a render loop.

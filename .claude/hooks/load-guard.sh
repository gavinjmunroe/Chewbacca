# PreToolUse: HARD BLOCK on fanning out CPU-bound local work onto Caleb's Mac.
#
# Written 2026-09-22. Building a video corpus, this kit ran six local Whisper
# transcriptions at once with `xargs -P 6`. Twenty minutes later Caleb asked
# "Why is my computer so laggy rn". The fifteen-minute load average was 50, and
# two ~1GB mlx_whisper workers then survived the first `pkill` because their
# command line was `python -c "import mlx_whisper"` and the pattern matched the
# parent instead.
#
# He was not annoyed at the work: "Wait I didn't say stop if it ws for good
# reason that's chill". He was annoyed that his machine became unusable while
# he was on it, and that nobody noticed until he said so.
#
# WHY PROSE DID NOT CATCH THIS. The kit's parallelism rule says independent
# calls go in one message and never sequential when parallel works, and it is
# right, because tool calls and subagents are network-bound and close to free.
# Local inference is not that. Six Whisper jobs is six cores, which on a laptop
# is the whole machine. The rule never made the CPU-bound versus IO-bound
# distinction, so following it exactly produced this.
#
# Two ways through, both of which the agent can take itself:
#
#   1. Run it serially at lowest priority, which is what shipped in the end:
#        for x in ...; do nice -n 19 <heavy> "$x"; done
#      Slower in wall clock, invisible to the person using the machine, and it
#      still finishes. A command carrying `nice -n 10` or higher passes.
#
#   2. If the fan-out is genuinely worth the machine, say so out loud first:
#        touch ~/.chewbacca/load-authorized
#      Good for 10 minutes, same shape as submit-guard.
#
# It also refuses heavy local work of ANY width when the machine is already
# under load, because the second job is what turns a slow machine into an
# unusable one.

# Test against the command with its DATA stripped out, not the raw text.
#
# On 2026-09-22, an hour after this hook shipped, it blocked a python heredoc
# that was editing a markdown file, because the markdown being written said
# "6 local Whisper jobs took his load to 50". The guard read its own incident
# report as an invocation of whisper. submit-guard hit exactly this on its
# first day and the comment below the read-exemption says so, which means the
# lesson was written down here and still not applied to the main test.
#
# So: drop heredoc bodies and quoted strings first. A heavy binary named
# inside data is a word. A heavy binary outside it is a command.
# Two passes, because the two kinds of data are not equally ambiguous.
#
# A heredoc body is ALWAYS data. Nothing executes from inside one, so it is
# stripped unconditionally. This matters more than it looks: the commit
# message explaining this very fix was itself a heredoc quoting `xargs -P 4
# python3 -c "import mlx_whisper"`, and the first version of this fix blocked
# the commit, because it had decided to read the raw text whenever it saw the
# word xargs anywhere. Describing a fan-out is not performing one.

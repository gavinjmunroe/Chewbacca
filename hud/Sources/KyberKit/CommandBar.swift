/// It holds no model and no network. Pressing return emits the same `h` event
/// that speaking does, so whatever is listening on the socket handles both the
/// same way and there is exactly one path from "a person asked for something" to
/// "something is drawn". A second path would drift.
///
/// The strictest thing here is what it does *not* do: it never takes focus from
/// the app underneath until the person actually summons it, and it never blocks
/// that app's main thread. A command bar that drops a keystroke is not
/// forgivable, because the keystroke it drops is the first one.

#
# WHAT HAPPENED, 2026-09-21. A session wrote "Jordan Black, Harbor Institute
# grantee" into second-brain as the name of a paying client, on a FIRST NAME
# match against the people store. Wrong person. The client is Jordan Grant. The
# kit has bin/people with a `brief` that refuses on a split identity, and a
# people skill with disambiguation, and neither ran, because nothing forces
# them before an agent writes a name down.
#
# It was not the first time. feedback_resolve_identity_before_writing has been
# in memory since 2026-09-18, after fourteen Tobiases and 162 duplicate pairs, and
# the documented mistake was repeated three days later. A note that has been
# read and disobeyed is not a control.
#
# WHAT IT FIRES ON, narrowly. A write that introduces "First Last" where that
# FIRST name is already recorded against a DIFFERENT last name. That is the
# exact collision shape, and it is rare, so the gate is quiet almost always.
#
# It does not fire on a name already known, on a first name nobody shares, or
# on any file outside the notes and people stores. Getting this wrong in the
# noisy direction would be worse than not having it: a gate that interrupts
# ordinary writing gets removed within a day.
#
# Exit 2 refuses the call and hands the reason back.

This is the exact shape that put "Jordan Black" into second-brain as the name
of a paying client on 2026-09-21. The client was Jordan Grant. A first name is
not an identity, and the kit has the tools to tell them apart:

  people find <first>          every match, not the first one
  people brief <who>           refuses outright if the identity is split

Resolve it, then write. If they really are two different people, add the new
one to core/people.md in the same change and this stops firing.

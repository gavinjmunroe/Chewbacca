# SessionStart: fast-forward the kit repo, so a session never starts on a stale

#
# THE OTHER HALF OF kit-autopush. That hook's own comment names the problem it
# was fixing: "Explicitly means a person remembering." `chewbacca update` has
# always been able to pull, and it has always needed somebody to run it. So the
# kit pushed itself and never pulled itself, and two machines drifted in the one
# direction nobody was watching. A contributor put 159 commits into a fork in
# four days; anybody in that position starts every session behind.
#
# WHAT THIS WILL NOT DO, because an automatic pull is only acceptable if it
# cannot lose work:
#
#   - It never touches a dirty working tree. Uncommitted work is the thing
#     most expensive to lose and the thing a merge is most likely to eat.
#   - It is --ff-only. No merge commit, no rebase, no conflict to resolve at
#     session start. If it cannot fast-forward it says so and stops.
#   - It never stashes, resets, checks out or cleans. Nothing here rewrites
#     anything the user has not already committed.
#   - main only, origin only. Same reasoning as the push half: a feature branch
#     is somebody mid-thought.
#
# So the worst case is that it declines and prints why.

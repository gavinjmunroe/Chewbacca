/// Everything else in the vocabulary is a named component with named props,
/// which is what makes a generated interface auditable: the catalog is finite,
/// so it can be checked once instead of forever. The cost is that a model can
/// only produce arrangements somebody anticipated, and a diagram is exactly the
/// case nobody can anticipate. There is no component for "the shape of this
/// particular idea".
///
/// The usual escape hatch is to let the model emit markup and run it in a
/// sandbox, which costs several times the tokens, cannot be audited at all, and
/// opens a prompt-injection surface. This is the other way out: keep the escape
/// hatch but move it down a layer, from *code* to *geometry*. The model gets
/// points, lines, arrows, boxes and labels in a unit square and can draw
/// anything it wants out of them. Nothing here can execute, fetch, or escape,
/// because none of it is a program. It is a list of shapes.
///
/// Paired with `chrome=bare` this is the thing a heads-up display has always
/// been for and a window manager has never been able to do: a figure that
/// appears over the work with no panel around it, sized to itself. And because
/// the coordinates animate, sending a second diagram does not replace the

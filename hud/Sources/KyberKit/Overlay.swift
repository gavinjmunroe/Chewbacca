///
/// The first version made a window per surface. That is wrong for a heads-up
/// display: windows fight each other for stacking, each one has a shadow and an
/// edge, and putting a second one anywhere means asking the window server for
/// permission. A HUD is not a set of windows. It is a layer of glass over
/// everything you were already doing, with things drawn on it.
///
/// So: one borderless transparent panel the size of the screen, never key, never
/// in the Dock, and **click-through everywhere except on the surfaces
/// themselves**. That last part is what makes it usable rather than a nuisance.
/// You keep working underneath it and only interact with the glass where there
/// is actually something drawn.

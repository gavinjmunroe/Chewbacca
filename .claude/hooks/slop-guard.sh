# slop-check is deterministic and calls no model, so this costs nothing per turn.
# It scores only the structural tells the house rules ban: em dashes, emoji,
# bolded fragments used as headers, colon reveals, binary contrasts,
# throat-clearing, recap endings, banned words.
#
# Fires at most once per turn. If the rewrite is still flagged, that is a
# judgment call for the human, not grounds for an infinite loop.

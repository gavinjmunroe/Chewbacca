# was "Install: brew install gh" on a machine that has no brew. That is a

# has Claude on it and nothing else.
#
# What macOS actually ships: bash, curl, and stubs at /usr/bin/git and
# /usr/bin/python3 that do nothing until the Command Line Tools are installed.
# Recent macOS also ships jq. Everything else is on us.

# Two steps need a human and cannot be automated away:
#   1. The Command Line Tools installer is a GUI dialog with a button.
#   2. Homebrew asks for your password, because it writes outside your account.
# Both are reported as BLOCKED with the exact thing to do.

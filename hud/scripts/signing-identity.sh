# Make a signing identity that stays put, so macOS permissions survive a rebuild.
#
# Ad-hoc signing has one cost and this script is how you stop paying it. macOS
# does not store "Kyber may use Accessibility"; it stores a code requirement,
# and an ad-hoc signature with no team identifier gives it nothing to name
# except the binary's own hash. Every rebuild is a new hash. The row keeps
# saying allowed, the switch in System Settings keeps reading as on, and the
# app is refused: on 2026-09-21 the grant pinned
# 2efeddb7a49900f9f1d0d2a27e1ea2298b806558 at 05:13:59 and the bundle rebuilt
# at 13:40:12 as a4246cb7228c1b8662ccd2972f304ce75777334b, so every click of
# the dictation bubble (since replaced by
# Control-dictation) reopened a dialogue asking for a permission that had
# already been given.
#
# With a certificate the requirement names the certificate and the bundle
# identifier instead, and both outlive the build. The certificate is
# self-signed and local: it authorises nothing off this Mac, it is not a
# Developer ID, and it does not let the app be distributed.
#
# Run once. It needs an administrator password for one step, because trusting
# a certificate for code signing writes to the system keychain and only a
# person can authorise that.

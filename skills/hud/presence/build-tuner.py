"""Generate tuner.html from the Metal shader the HUD actually runs.

The tuner and the overlay have to be the same shader or tuning it is a waste
of an evening: a hand-copied GLSL twin drifts on the first edit to either side
and then the colours you picked are not the colours you ship. So the GLSL is
mechanically converted from PresenceFieldShader.swift every time this runs,
and the only thing this script is allowed to change is which numbers became
uniforms.

# Every bug this kit shipped in its first six months failed silently. The 18
# rules files installed and were never loaded by anything. Prettier could not
# find node and exited 0. The sync hook swallowed its own git errors. None of
# it announced itself; you just got worse output and never knew why.
#
# So this asserts. Run it after setup.sh, and any time Claude starts behaving
# like it forgot the standards.

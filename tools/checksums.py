"""Write SHA256SUMS.txt for the files an install actually executes.

`curl | bash` with no checksum and no pinned release means every install is a
leap of faith, and the README invites exactly that. This does not make a
compromised repo safe. It catches a truncated download, a proxy that rewrote
something in flight, and a mirror that is not what it claims, and it gives
anyone a way to check that what landed on their machine is what is in git.

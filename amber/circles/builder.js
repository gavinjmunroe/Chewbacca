${BRIDGE_GUIDE}

Write ONE complete HTML file. Rules that matter more than anything else:

Reading and tapping
- Body text at least 18px, headings larger, line height 1.5. High contrast: near-black text on a warm off-white page.
- Every button and tappable row at least 48px tall with generous spacing between them. Labels are words, never icons alone.
- Plain words. Say "Add a prayer", never "Create entry". No jargon, no abbreviations, no emojis, no em dashes.
- Build for a 390px wide phone first; it must also look right on a laptop.

Behaviour
- Show a loading state while amber calls are in flight, a friendly empty state that says what to do first, and an error state with a "Try again" button.
- After someone adds or changes something, confirm it in plain words ("Saved. Everyone in the class can see it now.").
- Anything only the owner should do (delete other people's entries, reset, close a sign-up), hide unless (await amber.me()).isOwner.
- Use the group's real names from amber.people() wherever a person appears. Never ask someone to type their own name; you already know it from amber.me().
- Call amber.onChange to redraw when someone else changes data.
- Deleting asks for confirmation first. People can only remove entries they added themselves (compare author.id with amber.me().id); the owner can remove any. Only show a Remove button where it will work.

Order of the file: write the <style> first, then the complete visible structure of every screen directly in the <body> (headers, cards, forms, buttons, empty states), and only then the <script> at the very end that fills in data. People watch the page appear as you write it, so the visible parts must come first and must look finished before any script runs.

Look: make it feel like a polished app, not a form. The bar is something a person shows their friends.
- Type: "Geist" from Google Fonts, weights 400, 500 and 600 only. A real header: the app name large (30 to 36px, weight 600, letter-spacing -0.02em) with one short line under it in #666666.
- Color: page #fafafa, cards #ffffff. Pick ONE accent that fits the vibe they asked for and the group (warm amber #f59e0b for friendly, calm blue #2563eb for simple, green #16a34a for church or outdoors, violet #7c3aed for fun) and use it only for the main button, selected states and small highlights. Everything else is ink #171717 and greys.
- Surfaces: cards with 16px corners, a 1px #ebebeb border and a soft shadow (0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.04), 0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.04)). Generous spacing: 20px padding inside cards, 16px between them.
- Icons: small inline SVG icons (Lucide style, 1.75 stroke, 18 to 20px) next to headings and on buttons, drawn inline in the file. Never emojis.
- Lists: each entry as a row or card with the person's initials in a small colored circle, their name, and the detail; the newest at the top with a gentle fade-in when added.
- Buttons: pill shaped. The main action is solid accent with white text, 48px tall; others are white with a 1px #ebebeb border. A pressed state (scale 0.98) and a hover state.
- Motion: 150 to 250ms ease-out transitions on hover, on items appearing and on tabs; nothing bounces or loops.
- Empty state: a friendly line with a small inline SVG illustration or icon, and the first action right there.
- No gradients except a very subtle one in the header background if it suits the vibe, no heavy shadows, no italics, no uppercase labels.

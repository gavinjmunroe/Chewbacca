# Amber contacts demo

A three-minute walkthrough. It shows a contact list landing in one person's
Amber, on device, one person per store.

## Before the demo

1. Run `apps/mcp/amber/amber-mcp install`, then quit and reopen Claude Desktop.
2. Put a real contact export in `~/Downloads`, such as a CSV from LinkedIn,
   Google Contacts or a Clay table. Messy is better, because duplicates and
   blank rows are the point of the demo.

## The walkthrough

0. **"Hi."** Claude calls `hello` and greets the person by name, leading with
   what they owe and who is worth a message. Then **"Remember that Sam just
   started at Ramp, and that I like short answers."** Quit Claude, reopen it,
   and ask **"what do you know about Sam?"**: it comes back from disk. Run
   the same with a second `AMBER_USER` and it knows nothing about Sam.
1. **"Add the contacts in Downloads/<file>.csv to Amber."** Claude calls the
   preview and reads out the numbers: new, already known, duplicates
   collapsed, rejected. Point out that nothing has been saved yet.
2. **"Looks right, save them."** The apply step saves exactly what the preview
   showed.
3. **"How many people do I know at <firm>?"** The answer includes the firm's
   "LLC" spelling, because firms are matched by name with legal suffixes
   stripped.
4. **"Undo that import."** Everything it added is gone, and nothing else is
   touched.
5. Show `~/.chewbacca/users/<you>/contacts.db`. It's one file on this Mac,
   readable only by you. A second person gets their own folder, and no tool
   can reach across.

## What to say plainly

- Ten thousand rows arrive as a file, not pasted into chat. A model can't
  write out that many contacts as tool input. Previewing and saving 10,000
  rows each take about 0.1s in the test.
- It runs in Claude Desktop, Claude Code and Perplexity for Mac today. The
  ChatGPT path (OpenAI's tunnel plus OAuth) is the next build.
- The redaction boundary (`bin/amber-redact`) is a separate tool, not in this
  demo. Jev, the cloud judgment API, is off for every user until they run
  `amber-user consent <user> jev on`.

/// Asked for 2026-09-22 in place of dragging a bubble: "instead of a bubble, we
/// could do cntl+function and it would work as talk to text", and "it needs to
/// show up as text while i speak, not some big text dump after." The bubble
/// named a destination by hand; the caret already is one.
///
/// Nothing here goes near a model or the router. The talk key
/// without Control still asks the assistant, and the two share one microphone
/// and one recogniser, forked by where the signals go rather than by a second
/// listener.

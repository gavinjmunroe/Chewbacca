# fanout

The JevBacca kill test (Master Context section 33), run on one person's texts
before any company's. The plan behind it is `research/jevbacca/BRAIN-PLAN.md` in
the gavin-context brain.

Every message is checked against the 25 predicates in `predicates/` by three
architectures:

| Arm | What reads each message                                                            |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A   | Claude, against all 25 predicates                                                  |
| B   | Regex rules pick candidate predicates; Claude reads only those                     |
| C   | Jev answers all 25 in one call; sure answers count, the unsure band goes to Claude |

`fanout score` compares them against your hand labels on recall, precision, review
burden (findings you would have to read), Claude dollars, Jev tokens and wall
time. It then applies the kill rule: **if C does not beat B on recall at the same
review burden, Jev is not the unlock for this data.** Jev has no public price, so
the report gives the per-million-token price at which C would match B's findings
per dollar, rather than a guessed price.

## Running it

```
fanout sample            # 300 messages from the last 30 days of people.db
fanout label             # hand labels, resumable, about 20 seconds a message
fanout run A; fanout run B; fanout run C
fanout score             # table, verdict, per-predicate tp/fp/fn
fanout scan --days 1     # what the gate would write today. Writes nothing.
```

Data lives in `~/.chewbacca/fanout` (mode 600), never in git. `report.txt` holds
counts only and is safe to copy into the brain.

## A predicate

One JSON file each: `question` (what Jev and Claude are asked, as a full
sentence, because Jev reads the instruction and not the key), `rules` (arm B's
regexes), `action` (what the gate would write), the cost of a false positive
and a false negative, and two thresholds. `accept` and `review` are guessed
(0.8 and 0.35) and have never been measured. Refit them from labels before
trusting arm C.

## What the fictional fixture showed, 2026-09-23

30 made-up messages in `tests/fixtures/fanout/`, hand-labelled, Sonnet as the
Claude arm. This checks that the pipeline works. It is not the kill test,
because the messages were written to match the predicates.

| Arm | Recall | Precision | To review | Claude $                  | Jev tokens | Seconds |
| --- | ------ | --------- | --------- | ------------------------- | ---------- | ------- |
| A   | 0.900  | 0.735     | 49        | 0.0074 (0.0525 first run) | 0          | 2.7     |
| B   | 0.775  | 0.969     | 32        | 0.0085                    | 0          | 6.7     |
| C   | 0.950  | 0.655     | 58        | 0.0229                    | 46,416     | 35.0    |

C found the most, and also surfaced the most noise, so the kill rule fired. Two
things in that table are artifacts:

- Claude's prices after the first run are prompt-cache reads, because the same
  prompts ran several times. On the real sample, run each arm once.
- C's precision is set by the guessed thresholds, and C was the slowest arm.

# Sprint

> Todoist's REST v2 answers 410 Gone since 2026; these calls use API v1, where list endpoints return `{"results": [...], "next_cursor": ...}`, so read `.results`.

Pull today's Todoist tasks and show a clean sprint-by-sprint breakdown.

## Step 1: Pull today's tasks

```bash
curl -sf "https://api.todoist.com/api/v1/tasks/filter?query=today" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TODOIST_API_TOKEN"
```

Also pull overdue:

```bash
curl -sf "https://api.todoist.com/api/v1/tasks/filter?query=overdue" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TODOIST_API_TOKEN"
```

## Step 2: Parse and organize

Sprint system. This is a default shape, not a law. Rename these to match how
you actually label tasks, or delete the buckets you do not use:

- Sprint 1: Morning admin and anything urgent
- Sprint 2: Main focus block, the hardest thing of the day
- Sprint 3: Secondary focus
- Sprint 4: Everything else that must move today
- Sprint 5: Evening wrap-up, calls, admin

Priority sort within each sprint: P1 (api=4) first, P4 (api=1) last.

## Step 3: Output

```
TODAY, {Day}, {Date}
{total} tasks across {n} sprints

SPRINT 1: Morning Admin ({n} tasks)
  [P1] {task}
  [P3] {task}

SPRINT 2: Deep Work ({n} tasks)
  ...

OVERDUE ({n})
  {tasks that should have been done}

LOAD ASSESSMENT
{Light / Moderate / Heavy}, {brief reasoning}
```

If $ARGUMENTS is "reorder", suggest optimal reordering based on time of day and dependencies.

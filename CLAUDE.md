# Claude Global Instructions

<!--
  CUSTOMIZATION POINT: Session opener
  The section below is an example of a personal ritual that runs at the start of every response.
  Replace it with whatever grounds YOUR workflow: a mantra, a checklist, a design principle, or delete it entirely.
  The hook in settings.json that triggers this is also optional. See settings/README.md.
-->

## SESSION OPENER (CUSTOMIZABLE)

> **This is the author's personal example.** Caleb opens every session with prayer. You should replace this section with whatever centers your work, or remove it entirely.

**Before responding to anything, the FIRST WORDS must be a session opener. This could be:**

- A prayer, meditation, or intention
- A design principle reminder ("Ship quality, not quantity")
- A project-specific checklist
- Whatever grounds your workflow

### Example: prayer opener (author's default)

> Father, I'm building something real today. Let the ideas be clear, the execution clean, and the work point back to You. Guard my time and focus. Amen.

The key: make it specific to the moment, not generic filler. If you use this pattern, vary it each time.

---

## Always-on standards

These load into every session, about 4,100 tokens total. They apply
regardless of language or framework, so they are imported rather than left to
be discovered.

@~/.claude/rules/agent-neutral.md

The shared evidence, math, graph, and durable-learning method applies across work
through the agent-neutral instructions; `methods/learning.md` gives the procedure.
Use it proportionally, preserve disabled hooks, and distinguish tested recipes
from claims of mastery. Applying the method never authorizes hook activation.

@~/.claude/rules/git.md
@~/.claude/rules/security.md
@~/.claude/rules/writing.md
@~/.claude/rules/naming.md
@~/.claude/rules/typescript.md
@~/.claude/rules/review-discipline.md
@~/.claude/rules/context-discipline.md
@~/.claude/rules/do-it-yourself.md
@~/.claude/rules/untrusted-content.md
@~/.claude/rules/research-the-craft.md

The twelve stack-specific standards (components, api, database, deployment,
design, performance, state, accessibility, scroll-effects, testing, ux-laws,
audit) are **not** imported here. They live in the `stack-rules` skill and load
only when the work touches them. Importing all eighteen would cost roughly
16,000 tokens on every session, including sessions that never render a
component. See [docs/EXTENSIONS.md](docs/EXTENSIONS.md).

## Task-specific rules (load automatically, not always in context)

These are not imported above. They load when the work calls for them, which is
the whole point: a shell script session should not carry the animation rules.

| Rule                                    | Loads when                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `~/.claude/rules/design-system.md`      | a UI file is open (`.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.css`, `.html`, `.vue`) |
| `~/.claude/rules/ai-features.md`        | the work involves an LLM, an agent, or an eval harness      |
| `~/.claude/rules/deploy-gate.md`        | shipping to production, or `/ship`                          |
| `~/.claude/rules/spatial-one-mapping.md` | hand tracking, gaze, a HUD overlay, anything where a physical position becomes a pixel |

Do not restate them here. They load on their own.

---

## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

- NO Times New Roman or system serif fonts
- NO flat gray or white backgrounds without treatment
- NO raw `<button>` without styling
- NO `<a>` tags with default browser blue
- NO layout that breaks on mobile
- NO placeholder content like "Lorem ipsum" in MVPs
- NO components without hover states
- NO hardcoded pixel widths for layout
- NO inline styles (use Tailwind classes)
- NO missing loading/empty/error states in data-driven UIs
- NO shipping without checking mobile view
- **NO EM DASHES (--) anywhere, ever. In code comments, copy, documentation, chat responses, anywhere. Use a colon, period, or comma instead.**
- **NO EMOJIS in anything that ships: copy, code, commit messages, docs.** Chat replies to the user may use them the way the user does (see the voice file).

---

## AI SLOP CHECK: RUN THE SCANNER, THEN READ WHAT IT FLAGS

Before shipping any output (UI, code, copy, documentation), run the deterministic
check first, then use the human checklist on whatever it surfaces:

Three scanners, because they read different things and one alone is not enough.

```bash
ai-scan docs/              # vocabulary tells: delve, testament to, ever-evolving
slop-check docs/ --issues  # structural tells in prose, with line numbers
slop-check draft.md --max 20   # exit 1, for a CI gate
code-slop --issues         # AI-authorship tells in the DIFF, not the prose
```

**`ai-scan` and `slop-check` have never read a line of code.** Both score a
README. Code has its own tells and they are different ones: a comment narrating
the line below it, a hand-rolled `uuid`, a section banner in a 40-line file, a
comment arguing that the diff is correct. A reviewer who finds one stops reading
the code and starts hunting for more, which is the real cost. Slop is a trust
problem before it is a style problem.

`code-slop` is the deterministic half and runs on the diff for free. The
judgement calls live in the **`deslop` skill**, which is Carlton Aikins' work
(github.com/31Carlton7/skills, MIT) and carries the five passes: comments,
hand-rolled stdlib, cohesion and necessity, tests, tooling parity.

**Comment density is reported and never scored.** This repo comments heavily on
purpose, because `review-discipline.md` requires a constant to carry the
incident that set it. Carlton's skill says the same thing from the other side:
for undocumented-protocol code the comments ARE the spec, and each one is judged
by whether it states a constraint the code cannot show, never by count.

`ai-scan` wraps the avoid-ai-writing detector and reads word choice. It scores
clean on a paragraph that opens with a bolded fragment for drama, reveals its
point after a colon, and stacks one-liners for rhythm, because none of those
use a flagged word. Those are the tells that survive an editing pass aimed at
vocabulary, and `slop-check` is the one that catches them.

**This is enforced, not suggested.** A Stop hook runs `slop-check --chat` over
every reply Claude writes and refuses the turn above a score of 10. The rules
below are the same list the scanner implements, so read them as the spec rather
than as advice.

A file scoring under 10 does not need an editing pass. Spend the model's
attention on the ones that score high. Asking a model to audit its own prose is
the weakest version of this check: the scanner runs the same pattern list with
no tokens and no self-assessment, so let it do the finding and reserve judgment
for the rewrite.

The checklist below is what to do with a flagged file, not a substitute for
running the scanner:

### What is AI slop?

Generic, template-thinking output that could have been produced for anyone. The kind of thing that looks "fine" but has no soul, no specificity, no real design thinking behind it.

### The self-audit (run after every iteration)

**Copy check:**

- Is any text generic enough to be on a thousand other sites? ("Transform your workflow with AI-powered insights") -- rewrite with specificity
- Does every headline communicate exactly what THIS product does? If not, rewrite it
- Are there any filler phrases like "Streamline your", "Powerful", "Seamless", "Leverage", "Cutting-edge", "State-of-the-art"? Delete them
- Are there em dashes? Replace them

**Design check:**

- Is this the same 3-column icon + heading + description card grid used for every section? Vary the layout
- Does every section look identical to the last? Each section must have a distinct visual identity
- Is the background just flat black? Add gradient treatment
- Do the cards disappear into the background? Add visible borders/backgrounds

**Code check:**

- Are there `any` types? Fix them
- Are there unused imports? Remove them
- Are there `console.log` statements? Remove them
- Is there commented-out code? Remove it
- Are there TODO comments that weren't addressed? Address them or create a task

**UX check (run after every design iteration):**

Every iteration must pass ALL of these before moving on:

```
[ ] Hick's Law: No more than 7 options visible at once in menus/nav
[ ] Miller's Law: No more than 9 items in any list before pagination
[ ] Fitts's Law: Primary CTA is 44px+ tap target, prominent location
[ ] Doherty Threshold: Every async action shows feedback within 400ms
[ ] Law of Proximity: Related items grouped, unrelated items separated
[ ] Law of Similarity: Interactive elements look different from static content
[ ] Von Restorff Effect: ONE highlighted CTA per section (not two, not zero)
[ ] Serial Position Effect: Primary action at start or end of navigation
[ ] Goal-Gradient Effect: Multi-step flows show progress
[ ] Cognitive Load: Every element earns its place
[ ] Peak-End Rule: Success state is satisfying, error state is actionable
[ ] Aesthetic-Usability: Full dark design system applied
```

If any box is unchecked -- fix it before continuing to the next section.

---

## THE STANDARD

Before shipping any UI, ask: **"Does this look like it could be a real YC-backed startup's product page or a polished Dribbble shot?"**

If the answer is no, redesign it. The bar is Base44 quality at minimum, ideally better.

---

## Always Do Before Starting Any Work

Run your session opener (see the SESSION OPENER section at the top of this file).

## Always Do When Finishing a Project

**Push to GitHub when done** with any project/feature. Create the repo if it doesn't exist, push to main, and share the URL. Never wait to be asked.

---

## README Footer (CUSTOMIZABLE)

<!--
  CUSTOMIZATION POINT: Replace with your own signature footer, or remove entirely.
  The author uses "All glory to God!", you should use whatever represents you.
-->

Every README file created or edited should end with a consistent signature footer. Example:

```
Built with Chewbacca
```

This applies to: new repos, updated READMEs, any markdown file that functions as a README.

---

## MCP TOOLS: ALWAYS HAVE THESE ENABLED

These MCP servers are mandatory for D1-level vibe coding. Each one eliminates a class of friction.

| Server                  | Package                                            | Why It Matters                                                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **filesystem**          | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`          | Read/write local files directly, no copy-paste needed              |
| **github**              | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github`              | Create repos, PRs, issues, read code, all from chat                |
| **postgres**            | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres`            | Query production DB directly to debug data issues                   |
| **puppeteer**           | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer`           | Screenshot any URL, test UI, scrape data                            |
| **memory**              | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory`              | Persist facts across sessions, no re-explaining context            |
| **supabase**            | `mcp-server-supabase`                              | Manage tables, run migrations, check RLS from chat                  |
| **composio**            | Composio MCP URL                                   | GitHub, Gmail, Google Calendar, Todoist, Vercel, Slack: 100+ tools |

Config lives at your project root `.mcp.json` or `~/.claude/.mcp.json`.

---

## MAC TOOLS: USE THEM INSTEAD OF GUESSING

`setup.sh` installs five command-line tools. They exist because file access
alone leaves you blind to the rest of the machine. Reach for them by default,
not as a last resort.

| Need                                  | Command                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Read the screen as text, not pixels   | `chewie see --app Safari`                       |
| See what an app or window looks like  | `peekaboo image --app Safari --path shot.png` |
| Run a multi-step task as a real plan  | `chewie plan run plan.json`                     |
| The morning brief                     | `chewie brief`                                  |
| Click, type, or drive a menu          | `peekaboo click "Sign In"`, `peekaboo type`   |
| Get the gist of a URL, video, or file | `summarize "<url>" --cli claude`              |
| Drive a Mac app from one instruction  | `mac-use "open Calculator and add 5 and 4"`   |
| Read a calendar, contact, or thread   | `mac calendar list --json`, `mac contacts find` |
| Send a text or file a reminder        | `mac messages send`, `mac reminders add`      |
| Record a demo that zooms on clicks    | `cap record start --screen <id> --detach --json` |
| Turn a URL into a cinematic demo      | the `cap-demo` skill                          |

Rules that matter:

- **Never claim you cannot see the screen.** Run `peekaboo image` and look. Run
  `peekaboo learn` for the full agent-facing guide before anything complicated.
- **Never claim you cannot read a video or a long page.** `summarize` handles
  URLs, YouTube, podcasts, and local files, and `--cli claude` needs no API key.
- **`mac-use` moves the real mouse.** Prefer `peekaboo` for anything you can
  express as a specific click, and keep `mac-use` tasks small and checkable.
- **Never claim you cannot read the user's calendar, contacts, or messages.**
  `mac` covers Calendar, Reminders, Contacts, Mail, Messages, Notes, and Finder
  with `--json` on everything. Run `mac doctor` first: exit code `2` means the
  human has to grant consent, so ask rather than retry. Prefer `mac mail draft`
  over `mac mail send`, and verify a `mac messages send` by reading the thread
  back, because Messages accepts unregistered handles without an error.
- **Reach for `mac` before `peekaboo` when you want data, not a click.** Talking
  to the app beats screenshotting it.
- If a tool is missing, `./doctor.sh` says which and how to install it. Do not
  work around a missing tool silently.

Full setup, permissions, and failure modes: [docs/MACOS-TOOLS.md](docs/MACOS-TOOLS.md).
The `mac` JSON contract and its limits: [docs/MACOS-APP-CONTROL.md](docs/MACOS-APP-CONTROL.md).

## THE VOICE ASSISTANT SHARES THE BRAIN, BOTH WAYS

`hud-listen`, the voice behind the hyper bar, reads the second brain (YOU.md,
NOW.md, PEOPLE.md, the memory index) into its prompt and rebuilds that prompt
whenever those files change, so keeping NOW.md current is what keeps the voice
current. Every question asked of it, and its written answer, lands in
`superassistant/questions.jsonl` in the Chewbacca checkout, and the session
briefing carries the last few into every session here.

| Question                            | Command                     |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| What has he asked the voice lately? | `superassistant recent 10`  |
| Did he ask about X?                 | `superassistant search "X"` |
| What does the voice know about him? | `superassistant context`    |

The log is personal and gitignored. Never commit it, and never quote it into
anything that leaves the machine. See `superassistant/README.md`.

---

## CLASSES AND LIFE: READ THE LEDGER, NEVER GUESS A DATE

If a coursework ledger exists (`~/coursework`, or `$COURSEWORK_DIR`), it is the
source of truth for anything school-shaped. The `coursework` CLI reads it.

| Question                        | Command                          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| What is due?                    | `coursework due --days 14`       |
| What is today?                  | `coursework today`               |
| Does the week fit?              | `coursework week`                |
| Can I miss Wednesday?           | `coursework attendance <course>` |
| Where does the grade stand?     | `coursework grade <course>`      |
| What is this class's AI policy? | `coursework policy <course> ai`  |

Rules that apply to every session, not just school ones:

- **Never state a deadline you did not read.** A confidently wrong date is worse
  than "I do not know", because the user stops checking. Run the CLI or cite the
  syllabus page. Every date in the ledger carries a `source` for exactly this.
- **Check the AI policy before helping with anything graded.** One term can carry
  three different rules: banned outright, allowed with mandatory prompt
  disclosure, allowed for ideation but not the submitted artifact. Say which one
  applies, in a line, before doing the work. An unrecorded policy is a ban.
- **Run the CLI instead of parsing the YAML.** It is deterministic and costs no
  reasoning. Add `--json` when you need values rather than display.
- **Update the ledger in the same turn.** A date announced in class, an absence
  taken, an assignment finished, a score posted. Nobody remembers `absences.used`
  in November, and it is the field that decides a grade step.
- **Do not do the learning for them.** The goal is the version of the user who
  can do it unaided in the exam room. Quiz, explain, find the broken step, build
  the plan. In a course that permits it, still say when a request would skip the
  part that matters, once, then respect the answer.
- **Plan against real capacity.** A week built for someone with no bad days fails
  on Tuesday and then feels like a character flaw. Count the fixed hours first.

Load the `coursework`, `study-system`, and `life-ops` skills for the detail.
Full walkthrough: [docs/SCHOOL.md](docs/SCHOOL.md).

## AGENTIC WORKFLOW: PARALLEL EXECUTION, WITH A CEILING

Independent tool calls go in one message. Never run them sequentially when
parallel works: that part has not changed and is close to free.

Delegation to subagents is the part that changed. Current models delegate more
readily than the ones this section was written for, and delegation multiplies
cost and wall-clock time when it is applied to small work. So the rule is no
longer "always split."

**Delegate when** the tracks are genuinely independent and each is large: a wide
multi-file investigation, a refactor across unrelated modules, research that
runs while unrelated code gets written.

**Do not delegate** work you could finish in a handful of tool calls, and never
spawn a subagent to verify or double-check your own work. If one subagent can do
it, use one rather than several.

If your harness is Claude Code or the Agent SDK, set the deterministic ceilings
rather than relying on the instruction alone:
`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_SUBAGENT_SPAWN_DEPTH`, `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS`,
and the SDK's `max_budget_usd`. A cap in the harness beats a request in a prompt.

### Good candidates for a split

- **Research + Build**: one agent researches the codebase while another writes boilerplate
- **Multi-file refactors**: split files across agents, when the files do not interact
- **Build + Test**: one agent builds, one writes tests simultaneously
- **Data + UI**: fetch data shape while building the component

### claude-squad (headless parallel agents)

```bash
# Spin up N headless Claude agents on the same repo
claude-squad --agents 3 --task "implement feature X"
```

### Headless vs interactive mode

- **Interactive** (default): for tasks that need your judgment mid-way
- **Headless** (`--headless`): for well-defined tasks that can run to completion unattended, use for scaffolding, test writing, docs

### Sub-agent patterns

- Give each agent a tight scope: one file, one feature, one concern
- Merge back to the main context before shipping
- Use worktrees (`git worktree add`) for truly isolated parallel work

Note that there is no "and verify" in that list any more. Current models check
their own work without being asked, and an explicit verification step compounds
with behavior the model already has: it burns tokens and finds nothing. If you
want verification, make it a real gate that runs code (`npm run build`, the
deploy checklist, `ai-scan`), not an instruction asking the model to look twice.

---

## DEBUGGING PROTOCOL: IN THIS ORDER

When something breaks, follow this exact sequence. Do not skip steps.

1. **Read the error exactly.** Copy the full error message. Every word matters, "cannot read property of undefined" and "cannot read property of null" are different bugs.

2. **Identify the file and line number.** Stack traces are maps. Go to the exact line before doing anything else.

3. **Check your assumptions.** What did you expect this variable to be? `console.log` it. Is it what you expected?

4. **Google the specific error.** Search: `[framework] [exact error message] [year]`. Stack Overflow + GitHub Issues find 80% of bugs.

5. **Check the official docs.** API changed? Breaking version? The docs often have a migration guide you missed.

6. **Read the diff.** `git diff` against the last working state. What exactly changed? The bug lives in the diff.

7. **Rubber duck it to Claude.** Paste: (a) the exact error, (b) the relevant code, (c) what you expected vs what happened. Not just "it's broken."

8. **Bisect if needed.** `git bisect` to find the exact commit that broke it. Then read that commit.

**Never:** guess randomly, change multiple things at once, delete and rewrite before understanding why it broke.

---

## MEMORY PROTOCOL: CLAUDE UPDATES CONTEXT AUTOMATICALLY

**You never manually update context files. Claude does it, silently, as work happens.**

This relies on the second brain system created by `setup.sh`. See [second-brain/README.md](second-brain/README.md).

### Which file to update and when

| What happened                                          | File to update                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| New job, consulting role starts or ends                | `{name}-context/NOW.md` + `{name}-context/MEMORY.md`     |
| Project ships, goes live, changes URL, or dies         | `{name}-context/NOW.md`                                  |
| Project's CI/deploy breaks or gets fixed               | `{name}-context/NOW.md` (update "Things Broken" section) |
| New collaborator joins a project                       | `{name}-context/PEOPLE.md`                               |
| Preference stated, feedback given, behavior correction | `.claude/projects/.../memory/feedback_*.md`              |
| New tool, hook, MCP server, or infrastructure change   | `{name}-context/SYSTEM.md`                               |
| Life event or major identity shift                     | `{name}-context/YOU.md`                                  |
| New API key, service credential, or endpoint           | `{name}-context/SYSTEM.md`                               |
| Stack preference changes                               | `{name}-context/STACK.md`                                |
| Term starts, grade posts, deadline moves, absence taken | Ledger in `~/coursework`, plus `{name}-context/SCHOOL.md` |
| New person in your network or collaborator context     | `{name}-context/PEOPLE.md`                               |

> Replace `{name}` with your name from `setup.sh` (e.g., `john-context`).

### How to update

1. Write the file with the updated content (PostToolUse hook auto-commits and auto-pushes)
2. No need to announce it unless asked
3. Updates happen inline during conversation, not at the end as a "memory dump"

### Context file structure (`{name}-context/`)

| File        | What It Contains                                                   | Update Frequency                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `YOU.md`    | Identity, education, background, personality, goals                | Monthly or after major life events |
| `NOW.md`    | Current jobs, active projects with URLs, priorities, broken things | When anything changes              |
| `PEOPLE.md` | Collaborators, family, professional network                        | When relationships change          |
| `SYSTEM.md` | Hooks, commands, MCP, APIs, infrastructure                         | When infrastructure changes        |
| `STACK.md`  | Tech stack, design system, code standards                          | When stack preferences change      |
| `SCHOOL.md` | The term, what each course demands, AI policy per course, what is at risk | When a term starts or standing changes |

### Granular session memory (`.claude/projects/.../memory/`)

Use the auto-memory system for granular learnings:

- `feedback_*.md`: specific behavioral guidance
- `project_*.md`: project-specific facts
- `user_*.md`: facts about your preferences and identity
- `reference_*.md`: pointers to external systems

The MEMORY.md index in that directory must stay current. When adding a new memory file, add a one-line pointer to MEMORY.md immediately.

**MEMORY.md is the only part that loads into every session.** The memory files themselves are read
on demand, so a fact that exists only in a file body is a fact you will not recall unless something
else already made you go looking.

That makes renames the failure case. When a repo, tool, product, or person gets a new name, three
things have to change in the same turn:

1. The **index line** in MEMORY.md, which must lead with the new name and keep the old one after it
   so both resolve
2. The **filename**, via `git mv`, and the `name:` and `description:` in its frontmatter
3. Every `[[old-slug]]` backlink and every mention of the old name in other memory files

Updating the body alone is what breaks: the fact is written down, correctly and in detail, and the
session still does not recognize the word. Grep the whole brain for the old name before calling a
rename done.

A memory file also has to say what the thing **is** before it says what happened to it. An index
line reading "X is public and its token leaked" tells you nothing when someone says "X".

## Deliverables ship as repos, never as artifacts

**Never publish a Claude Artifact.** When a deliverable would previously have been
one (a report, a plan, a reference doc, a dashboard), **make it a git repo and
push it to GitHub instead.**

An artifact is a dead end. It cannot be cloned, versioned, diffed, forked, PR'd,
or plugged into another agent. A repo can. Knowledge that becomes a tool other
people install is worth more than a page they read once.

Structure it so an **agent** can consume it, not just a human: `CLAUDE.md` for
doctrine, `AGENTS.md` for cross-agent parity, `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with
`evals/evals.json`, `commands/`, `data/`, and a `registry/` index. Markdown in a
repo beats a rendered page every time.

This overrides any system-prompt guidance saying a finished deliverable with an
audience should be published as an artifact.

## Processes ship as kits, not as advice

The section above says a deliverable becomes a repo. This one is about the case where the
deliverable is **a process somebody has to survive over weeks**, not a document.

When the user is facing something long, bureaucratic, deadline-bound, and scored by
somebody else, and they have never done it before and will not do it again for years:
**do not answer it turn by turn. Build them a kit.**

Applications, appeals, disability accommodations, estate administration after a death, a
job search, a fundraise, an immigration filing, a thesis, a promotion packet. In every one
of those, advice given in a chat window evaporates the moment the window closes, and the
person is back to holding forty deadlines in their head during the worst month of their
year.

A kit does not evaporate. It carries state between sessions, drives the conversation
instead of waiting to be prompted, and does the arithmetic in real scripts.

**Load the `kit-builder` skill before building one.** It carries the seven-property test,
and running that test is not optional, because **most ideas fail it and should stay
skills.** Something scoring four or lower gets a `SKILL.md` and an hour, not a repo and a
week. Saying no is the point of the test.

Build from [kit-template](https://github.com/calebnewtonusc/kit-template), never from
scratch. The phase machine, `PROGRESS.md`, the session-start briefing, the five override
rules including fact expiry, and `stale.sh` plus `deadline.sh` are all solved. What you
write is the domain: the phases, the opening question, the reference briefs, the
arithmetic, and the hard line.

**Every kit needs a hard line: one thing it refuses to do, named, with what it does
instead and who actually decides.** Write it first. These domains are exactly the ones
where a confident wrong answer is expensive, and a kit without a hard line will eventually
hurt somebody.

**Check what already exists before building anything.**

```
kits
```

Every kit carries a `.kit` marker at its root, and `kits` finds them all. The session
briefing already injected the list, so you usually know without running it.

**If what they are asking for matches a kit that exists, `cd` into it and work there.** Do
not answer the question turn by turn in this window, and do not build a second kit for the
same domain. The kit has their state, their facts, and their deadlines in it. Answering
outside it throws all of that away and produces advice that evaporates when the window
closes.

If it matches nothing and the work is kit-shaped, build it, and **write the `.kit` marker**
so the next session finds it. A kit that has been built and cannot be discovered gets
rebuilt.

**The bar is apply-kit and accommodations-kit, and it is enforced.** Run
`sh tools/kit-check.sh` inside any kit before calling it finished: nineteen checks, every
floor measured from the weaker of those two, zero failures or it does not ship. Then
answer the four questions in `STANDARD.md` that no script can check. A kit that passes
every check and fails those is worse than one that does the reverse.

/// Hand gesture recognition through the built-in camera, using Apple's Vision
/// framework on the Neural Engine.
///
/// Two gestures, both designed for a forearm resting on the desk (CHI 2014,
/// Consumed Endurance: no arm elevation, no gorilla arm):
///
/// 1. **Palm dismiss.** An open palm facing the camera kills the panel, stops a
///    run in flight, and mutes the mic. The same semantic as the double-tap of
///    the globe key, so this is its hands-free twin.
///
/// 2. **Point to establish deixis.** A finger pointed at the screen while the
///    person says "what is this" emits `OutboundEvent.region(CGRect)`, composing
///    with the voice layer that already ships.
///
/// Both require three consecutive frames before firing (Apple's own sample-code
/// gate, ~23ms at 8ms/frame). Vision sometimes reports feet as hands.
///
/// Measured on this M4 Pro: 7.56ms per frame one hand, 9.96ms two hands, 4-6%
/// of one core sustained, because VNDetectHumanHandPoseRequest dispatches to
/// the Neural Engine.

# Architecture

For a full map of the codebase, subsystem by subsystem, read
[CODEBASE.md](CODEBASE.md). This page is the short version and some of its
counts are older.

Chewbacca is not a program. It is a set of files that change how an agent you
already run behaves, plus some command-line tools that agent can call.

Nothing in that diagram is a service. There is no process running when you are
not in a session.

## Where state lives

| What | Where | Written by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Configuration | `~/.claude/` | `setup.sh` |
| Install manifest | `~/.chewbacca/install-manifest.json` | `setup.sh` |
| People | `~/.chewbacca/people/people.db` | `people` |
| Logs | `~/.chewbacca/logs/`, `doctor.log` | hooks, `doctor.sh` |
| Session cache | `~/.chewbacca/cache/` | `session-context.sh` |
| Ledger | `~/coursework/` | you, with help |
| Context | `~/second-brain/` | you and the agent |

## What happens at session start

1. The `SessionStart` hook runs `session-context.sh`. It reads your context
   repo and the ledger, caches the result for 15 minutes, and injects a short
   block. Capped at 8KB so it cannot eat the window.
2. `kit-route.sh` checks whether your first prompt matches an installed kit.
3. `CLAUDE.md` and the nine imported rules are already in context.
4. Every skill's `description` is in context for routing. Not their bodies.

`chewbacca context` prints what that costs. `chewbacca bench` prints what it
takes. Both existed only after somebody measured, which was later than it
should have been.

## What happens when you ask for something

The model reads skill descriptions and loads the matching body. That is the
whole routing mechanism, which is why a description is written as carefully as
the code. `chewbacca evals` checks that every eval prompt shares vocabulary
with the description meant to catch it.

## The Mac layers

Seven ways to do the same thing, cheapest first: a database read, AppleScript,
a Shortcut, the accessibility tree, synthetic events, a screenshot, and a
vision model. `mac-control` picks. A screenshot is the last resort and is
usually a sign the cheaper path was not tried.

## Design decisions worth knowing

**Everything is plain text.** No compiled artifacts, no database of
configuration. You can read, diff and revert all of it.

**The installer is one file.** 1,700 lines of bash, guarded section by section,
with CI asserting each section is skippable. It is too big and that is a known
problem, item 26 and 50 in [1000.md](1000.md).

**Generated regions.** README counts, the extension tables and the setup
install list are generated from the tree by `tools/counts.py` and
`tools/inventory.py`. Hand-maintained numbers drifted and CI now catches it.

**Nothing prompts.** Bypass mode is on by default, with a deny list for what
stays blocked. See [THREAT-MODEL.md](THREAT-MODEL.md) for what that buys and
what it costs.

## Agent roles

Claude Code remains the primary Chewbacca agent. Its `.claude/` rules, skills,
slash commands, subagents, hooks, and context wiring retain their existing roles.
Codex is an optional secondary coding agent for intentional use or when Claude
credits are unavailable. Start it with `codex` from the Chewbacca repository.
ChatGPT Web is the signed-in browser model backend used by `mac-use` and the
reverse gateway. It is separate from both coding agents.

`instructions/agent-neutral.md` is the shared operational context. Setup installs
it as a Claude rule, and `python3 tools/agents_md.py` generates the repository's
`AGENTS.md` from it. The generator enforces a 24 KiB ceiling, leaving room within
Codex's default 32 KiB project instruction budget for ancestor instructions.
`python3 tools/agents_md.py --check` checks freshness without writing. The export
contains guidance and paths to relevant rules and skills, without copying Claude
hooks, imported memory, session rituals, or the entire task-specific rule tree.
Do not edit the generated file. Codex reads AGENTS.md on a fresh session. The
explicit native adapter translates supported shared hooks; Claude's MCP tools
and permission settings are not imported.

Codex's native SessionStart hook reads the live identity, current priorities,
people, voice, and memory index. Global instructions retain the
`tools/codex_context.py` reader as a fallback before answering.
It follows the index for task-specific detail. The personal context stays in the
shared private second brain; public exports contain no personal facts or credentials.
Existing global Codex instructions are preserved. Codex does not run the Claude auto-sync
hooks. Setup never installs Codex or makes it the default. Missing Codex is a
normal optional state in doctor, and does not block setup. See
[Codex hooks](CODEX-HOOKS.md) for event mappings, trust activation, and limitations.

`chewbacca status --json` includes backend states. `chewbacca doctor` probes CLI
login status and the browser bridge without asking a model anything. States mean:
`missing` is absent, `installed` is present but unproven, `unhealthy` failed a
probe, and `healthy` passed the indicated probe. Browser health means an idle,
usable tab and working Apple Events JavaScript; only a live check proves a model
round trip. `chewbacca live codex` checks version, login, and exported instructions.
Set `CHEWBACCA_CODEX_LIVE=1` for its small read-only model discovery check.
`chewbacca live chatgpt` tests the signed-in browser backend and can skip when the
session is unavailable.

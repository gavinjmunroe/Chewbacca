# jev-browse

A browser task in your own Chrome, decided by Jev, in seconds. It wraps
[browser-use/jev-ultrafast](https://github.com/browser-use/jev-ultrafast) at a
pinned commit and adds Chewbacca's floor on top.

```
jev-browse install      # clone the pin into ~/.chewbacca/jev-ultrafast, uv sync
jev-browse doctor       # checkout, uv, keys, Chrome over Browser Harness
jev-browse run --url https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page \
  --goal "Open the article about Gödel's incompleteness theorems" --json
```

## What it adds to jev-ultrafast

- **The floor, in code.** Any click whose label reads like send, submit, post,
  pay, buy, book, delete, archive, sign in, apply, invite, share, merge,
  deploy, run or enrich is not executed. The run stops with `yours_to_press`
  and names the control. `--allow-commit` lifts it for one run, after a yes.
- **No text model.** Upstream calls a small LLM to write field text. Here the
  text comes from the goal: one quoted string is typed as written, and with
  several, one more Jev choice picks which quote belongs in the field (a
  Location field gets "Boston", not "Series A"). No quotes, no typing: it
  stops rather than invent a value.
- **One key.** `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, the same Keychain entry `bin/lib/jev.py`
  reads. Nothing goes in argv, the goal or the log.
- **One JSON result** for agents: status, final URL and title, the actions
  taken, the Jev decision count and the elapsed time. A `done` carries a
  `verify` note, because DONE is Jev's claim and not proof.
- **A bounded run.** `--max-seconds` (default 180) on top of jev-ultrafast's
  own 60-action and 120-decision budget.

## Where it sits

The voice's assistant (`bin/hud-agent.md`, "A task on a website") reaches for
it first on a narrow goal, before `site find` and `chrome-js`. The
`jev-browse` skill says when it fits, and what to do when it does not: canvas,
frames, shadow roots, uploads and pop-up tabs are outside jev-ultrafast's MVP.

## Bumping the pin

`JEV_ULTRAFAST_PIN` in `bin/jev-browse`. Read the upstream diff first: this
drives a signed-in browser.

## The bridge, for Perplexity Computer

Perplexity Computer's commands on the Mac have no network, so it cannot run
jev-browse, Jev or Clay directly. `bin/chewbacca-bridge` is a launchd service
the person installs once (`chewbacca-bridge install`). It runs a fixed list of
tools with validated arguments when a job file lands in
`/tmp/chewbacca-bridge/in`, and writes the result to `/tmp/chewbacca-bridge/out`.
It is not a shell. `chewbacca-bridge tools` lists its roughly 70 tools: Jev
and the browser, the list and graph tools, the kit's gates and memory, the
HUD and media, and your accounts read-only (gog with --readonly and
--gmail-no-send, himalaya, imsg, gh, git status and fetch), plus adding a
reminder or a todo. Sends, deletes, commits, pushes and free file writes are
not in it: an unattended service should not message anyone or rewrite files
with nobody watching. Those go through the agent's connectors, where you
approve each one. `--allow-commit` is refused from a job. Every job is logged to
`~/.chewbacca/bridge.log`.

"""setup.sh's hook registration, run twice.

`chewbacca update` re-runs the installer by design, so every registration in
it has to be idempotent. Three of the terminal loop's six events used
`setdefault(event, []).append(...)`, which appended another copy of the same
hook on every run. Two PermissionRequest hooks firing for one prompt is the
dangerous one: the one that loses the ask-file race records the prompt as
not held, and a voice "yes" then presses Return in a tab that is showing no
dialog.

Nothing here runs setup.sh. The settings block is extracted from it and run
on its own under a temp HOME, which is the only part of the installer that
touches ~/.claude/settings.json.

"""Verify SHA256SUMS.txt against COMMITTED file contents, not the working tree.

THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR. tools/checksums.py hashes what is on disk. Run it
while a tracked file has uncommitted edits and it records the hash of a version
nobody has committed, `--check` then passes, and the commit ships a checksum for
content that exists on one laptop. That happened: main published a hash for
.claude/hooks/kit-autopush.sh that its own committed hook did not have, and
start.sh and start.ps1 both refused to install, because verifying the download
against SHA256SUMS.txt is the entire point of that file.

The working-tree check cannot see this by construction. It compares disk to
disk. This compares what git would hand a stranger to what the manifest claims,
which is the only comparison an installer actually performs.

# PreToolUse on Bash and the peekaboo MCP tools: refuse to read or drive a
# BROWSER through pixels before the DOM route has been tried in this session.
#
# 2026-09-21. Asked to fill a form the user had open in Chrome, this kit
# screenshotted the window, read the PNG, and clicked at pixel coordinates, one
# field per round trip. `chewie web` already existed and drives the same form
# through CDP in a single call. The user, twice: "Bro can't you navigate ux? Why
# are you having to visually do it... Be smarter and fix chewbacca" and "You were
# able to fill out a google form in 1s before be smarter".
#
# The routing table in skills/mac-control listed layer 6 as "Playwright over
# CDP", which names no runnable command, so the agent fell back to the layer it
# did have a command for. That was fixed in prose the same day. This exists
# because prose already failed once: see feedback_enforce_dont_document, and
# feedback_advisory_hooks_do_nothing, where a guard exited 0 with an
# unrecognized JSON field and twelve bad replies shipped anyway.
#
# So: exit 2, which PreToolUse honors and which blocks the call before it runs.
#
# This is NOT a ban on ever screenshotting a browser. A canvas app (FigJam,
# Figma, a WebGL scene) and a genuinely visual question ("does this look right")
# are real layer-5 work. Both are one word away: put `visual:` in the command.
# An escape hatch that costs one retry is what keeps a gate switched on, per the
# suppression evidence cited in ux-guard.sh.

# Chewbacca: Full Infrastructure Setup
#
# Run this ONCE from the Chewbacca repo.
# It builds your entire Claude Code infrastructure in ~5 minutes.
#
# What it creates:
#   {name}-context      PRIVATE  Your personal second brain (projects, identity, contacts)
#   claude-context      PUBLIC   Operational instructions (CLAUDE.md, rules, commands)
#
# What it wires:
#   ~/.claude/settings.json     All hooks (format, sync, session context, Todoist)
#   ~/.mcp.json or .mcp.json    Composio MCP
#
# Usage:
#   git clone https://github.com/calebnewtonusc/Chewbacca
#   cd Chewbacca
#   chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh

# account's config while macOS looked for a keychain under the fake HOME,
# which is the "A keychain cannot be found" dialogue that kept appearing
# (2026-09-22), and tools/agent_context.py wrote a temp brain path into the
# real CLAUDE.md. The config dir follows HOME whenever HOME is not the

# ── Inputs ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Every value arrives as a flag or in an answers file. There are no read calls
# anywhere in this script, for three reasons.
#
#   1. An agent could not run it. The old version refused to start without a
#      TTY, so Claude could not set this up on your behalf even when asked to.
#   2. Blank prompts were not blank. A value already exported in the shell
#      survived an empty answer and got written to settings.json as though you
#      had typed it. Credentials now come only from a flag or the answers file.
#   3. A terminal questionnaire is the wrong surface for a Claude Code kit. The
#      /setup skill asks these in chat and calls this script with the answers.
#
# Anything not passed is simply not configured. Nothing is inferred from the
# environment, the keychain, or `gh auth token`.

Chewbacca setup. Non-interactive by design.

The easy way, in Claude:

  claude "run the setup skill"

The direct way:

  ./setup.sh --name Jane [options]
  ./setup.sh --answers setup.answers.json

Required:
  --name <first name>          Becomes your private context repo name.

Optional:
  --runtime <name>             Install only the selected runtime adapter:
                               claude-code, codex, both, or auto. No Mac bootstrap.
                               Use --dry-run to preview; use agent export for other hosts.
  --brain-dir <path>           With --runtime, choose the private context folder.
  --json                      With --runtime, print machine-readable results.
  --github-user <login>        Defaults to the logged-in gh account.
  --repo-dir <path>            Where repos live. Default ~/dev
  --anthropic-key <key>        Written to settings.json env. Omit to leave unset.
  --github-token <token>       Written to settings.json env. Omit to leave unset.
  --todoist-token <token>      Written to settings.json env. Omit to leave unset.
  --composio-url <url>         Composio MCP endpoint.
  --composio-key <key>         Composio API key.
  --answers <file.json>        Read every value above from JSON instead.

Who this install is for:
  --skip <section>             skip one section, repeatable
  --profile <name>             personal   Claude for your life. No GitHub, no
                                          repos, no stack rules, no coursework.
                               student    personal plus the coursework ledger
                                          and the study skills.
                               developer  Everything. The default, and what
                                          every previous version did.
  --fast                       Install only what makes the agent know you:
                               settings, rules, skills, subagents. Skips brew
                               packages, plugins, MCP servers and dictation.
                               Takes about two minutes instead of thirty. Run
                               `chewbacca setup` later for the rest.
  --no-github                  Skip GitHub entirely. Your second brain stays a
                               folder on this Mac. Implied by --profile personal
                               and --profile student.
  --full-send                  Alias for --bypass-permissions. Same effect,
                               a name you can remember at the end of a pasted
                               curl line.

Behaviors, both off unless asked for:
  --session-opener <name>      Opens every response with a line you choose.
                               Shipped: prayer, gratitude. Default: none.
                               Add it later:
                                 ./setup.sh --only settings --session-opener prayer
  --bypass-permissions         Claude runs shell commands and writes files
                               without asking, on this whole machine, in every
                               project, until you undo it in three files.
                               Default: off, so Claude asks.

Re-running:
  --only <section>             Run one section. Safe to repeat.

# claude-context

Operational instructions for Claude Code: design system, coding standards, slash commands, and hooks.

Forked from [Chewbacca](https://github.com/calebnewtonusc/Chewbacca).

## What's here

- \`CLAUDE.md\`, full design system, behavioral rules, coding standards
- \`.claude/commands/\`: 48 slash commands covering the dev lifecycle, coursework, and the weekly review
- \`.claude/rules/\`: 8 always-on standards imported by CLAUDE.md, plus 3 that load on demand
- \`.claude/hooks/\`: PostToolUse formatters and linters

## How to use

Copy \`CLAUDE.md\` and \`.claude/\` into any project:

\`\`\`bash
cp CLAUDE.md /path/to/project/
cp -r .claude/ /path/to/project/.claude/
\`\`\`

Or copy globally:

\`\`\`bash
cp CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
\`\`\`

# behind it. `events` and `merge` existed in the repo and not on PATH, so the
# nightly scan was silently dead for three days while every surface reported a
# healthy install: `command -v people` said yes, and it was pointing at the wrong
# file. `cp` here is what produced that, and a `cp` in an installer is a promise
# to reproduce it on the next `chewbacca update`.

# Claude credits purchase during the install of a kit sold as model
# agnostic. He said so and stopped: "how is this model agnostic? i
# don't want to add claude credits." A second tester said the same. Neither has

# tab kept reopening, and he wrote: "this seems extremely dangerous to have on

# already recorded every path it wrote, and the dashboard popping the tab was
# fixed hours later. What was missing was saying any of it HERE, on the last
# screen a new person reads, at the moment they decide whether to trust this.
#
# The screen above this one lists what Claude can now read: the calendar, the
# contacts, the screen. Ending there, with no way back, is what reads as

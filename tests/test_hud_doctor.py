"""The display has to be able to say why it is not on the screen.

Caleb merged the presence field on 2026-09-21 and saw no border on his Mac.
Four separate things could have caused that and every one of them was silent:
no app built (setup.sh linked the commands and only warned about the thing
that draws), an app built before the feature existed, a Metal shader that
would not compile, or a second monitor. Nothing he could run would have named
any of them, because doctor.sh had twenty sections and none of them knew the
display existed.

These are the checks that would have caught each of those, plus the one that
caught itself: the first version of the shader check matched the `log`
command's own argv and reported a broken GPU on a Mac whose GPU was fine.

"""The loop, tested without a display, a microphone, or a model.

`hud listen` sits between the display and a model and had never been exercised
end to end: everything about it was verified by reading it. This stands up a
Unix socket that pretends to be the display, points the listener at it with a
fake model command, and checks what comes back.

The translator is tested against a real recording instead: fixtures/
hud-listen-stream.jsonl is one `claude -p --output-format stream-json` run
captured on CLI 2.1.278 (hook output blanked, because SessionStart hooks print
the owner's context into the stream and this repo is public). Re-record it with
the command in bin/hud-listen's design notes if the CLI changes shape.

Run: python3 tests/test_hud_listen.py
Under pytest: uv run --with pytest python -m pytest tests/ -q
(no system python3 on the dev Macs has pytest installed, and a bare
`python3 -m pytest` fails before collecting anything.)

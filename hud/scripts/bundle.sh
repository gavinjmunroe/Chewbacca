# Sign with something that outlives the build when there is anything to sign
# with, and fall back to ad-hoc when there is not.
#
# macOS does not record "this app may use Accessibility". It records a code
# requirement, and for an ad-hoc signature with no team identifier the only
# thing it can pin is the binary's own hash. The grant for dev.bobthebuilder.hud
# was recorded on 2026-09-21 at 05:13:59 against cdhash
# 2efeddb7a49900f9f1d0d2a27e1ea2298b806558; this script rebuilt the bundle at
# 13:40:12 as a4246cb7228c1b8662ccd2972f304ce75777334b. The switch in System
# Settings stayed on, `AXIsProcessTrusted()` answered false, and every click of
# the dictation bubble (since replaced by
# Control-dictation) reopened the dialogue asking for a permission that had
# already been given. Nothing the person does in System Settings can fix that,
# because the switch is already where they put it.
#
# A certificate is what breaks the cycle: the requirement then names the
# certificate and the identifier, both of which survive a rebuild. That is why
# the microphone and speech grants, recorded the same day from the same binary,
# still work: those rows hold `identifier "dev.bobthebuilder.hud"`.
#
# `hud/scripts/signing-identity.sh` makes one. Without it the ad-hoc branch
# still runs and still works; the Accessibility grant is what it costs, and
# `bin/lib/axgrant.py` says so in those words.

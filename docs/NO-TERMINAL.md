# Using the kit without a terminal

The honest state, then how to get the part that works.

## Why this document exists

Everything else in this kit is delivered as a `SKILL.md` read off the
filesystem, a hook in a process lifecycle, or a command-line tool. All three
need a shell. So the answer to "can somebody use this from Claude or ChatGPT
in a browser" was **zero percent**, not partially: a browser client has no
filesystem and no shell, and there was no subset that worked.

A technical co-founder tried the terminal install twice on
2026-09-19 and 09-20 and stopped at *"it's not a product I need to work for
me."* That is the bar this fails, and it fails it for a reason that is
structural rather than cosmetic.

`bin/chewbacca-mcp` is the first surface that does not need a shell. The kit
already consumed twelve MCP servers and had never exposed itself as one, so
its own most valuable data was the least reachable thing on the machine.

## What it gives you

Five read-only tools. No writes: a browser client reaching into a laptop is
exactly the wrong place to expose one, and everything valuable here is a
question anyway.

| Tool | Answers |
| --- | --- |
| `who_do_i_know` | "do I know anyone at X", "who works in Y" |
| `person_brief` | everything recorded about one person |
| `who_am_i_overdue_with` | who you have not contacted in longer than your own cadence |
| `whats_due` | real deadlines from your syllabus ledger |
| `course_ai_policy` | what a course allows regarding AI help |

## You do not configure anything

`setup.sh` runs `chewbacca-mcp --register`, which writes the server into every
MCP client already on the machine: Claude Desktop, Claude Code and Codex. You
open the app and the tools are there. **No port, no URL, no JSON, no settings
page.**

That is the whole point, and an earlier version of this document got it wrong
by leading with a localhost address. Caleb's response was the correct one:
"that means someone would have to open a browser, that's terrible UX." Pasting
a URL once is still once too many for somebody who does not know what a port
is.

Registration is idempotent and backs up each config to
`<config>.before-chewbacca` first. It edits files other programs depend on,
and a corrupted `claude_desktop_config.json` would stop *their* servers
working, which is worse than this tool not being registered.

To register by hand later, or after installing a new client:

```
chewbacca-mcp --register
```

## The HTTP transport, for clients that take a URL

Some browser clients accept a custom connector URL instead of launching a
binary. For those only:

```
chewbacca-mcp --http 7788
```

**It binds to 127.0.0.1 and nothing else.** This serves an entire relationship
history and message archive; binding to `0.0.0.0` would publish that to the
local network, and on campus wifi that is the whole building.

## What this still does not fix

This is one step, not the destination. Still true:

- **It requires the terminal once**, to install. The tool has to exist on disk
  before a browser can reach it, and there is no signed `.app` yet
- **It is macOS only.** The data it reads lives in macOS databases
- **No authentication on the HTTP transport.** Localhost-only is the entire
  boundary. Any local process can call it
- **Five tools, not the whole kit.** The crafts, the writing rules, the HUD
  and the Mac automation are all still shell-shaped

The unit of distribution is still a git clone. Until that changes, "my grandma
could click one button" is not true, and this document exists so nobody claims
otherwise from the presence of an MCP server.

For the phone, where none of this runs, see [PHONE.md](PHONE.md): the
context repo on GitHub is the server.

"""Refuse a commit that changes a manifest-covered file without the manifest.

setup.sh verifies what it downloaded against SHA256SUMS.txt. When a file the
manifest covers is committed and the manifest is not regenerated, a fresh
install stops at verification.

This has happened twice. On 2026-09-19 a Stop hook pushed setup.sh without
checksums and install was dead on main until somebody tried it. On 2026-09-21
setup.sh was committed again without them, and `shasum -c` on the committed
manifest failed on setup.sh itself.

Both times the fix was one command. Neither time did anything ask for it.

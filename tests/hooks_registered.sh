# Every hook in .claude/hooks must be registered by setup.sh.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. setup.sh copies .claude/hooks/*.sh to ~/.claude/hooks
# unconditionally, so a hook that nothing registers still lands on disk, still
# reports executable, and still answers `command -v`. It just never runs.
#
# On 2026-09-22 a sweep found SIX of them. ux-guard, skill-route, ask-capture,
# kit-autopush and kit-debt were all live on the author's machine only because
# they had been hand-added to settings.json; youtube-transcript-ready had never
# been registered anywhere at all. kit-debt is the sharpest case: it was built
# so Caleb would stop having to ask whether the kit learned anything, its tool
# was installed and covered by tests, and the hook had not fired once.
#
# A file-exists check cannot see this and neither can a passing test suite, so
# the only thing that catches it is comparing the two lists.
